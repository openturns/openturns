%feature("docstring") OT::LogisticFactory
"Logistic factory.

Notes
-----
The parameters are estimated by method of moments:

.. math::
    :nowrap:

    \begin{eqnarray*}
      \displaystyle\Hat{\alpha} = \bar{x}\\
      \displaystyle\Hat{\beta} = \Hat{\sigma}_x
    \end{eqnarray*}

%feature("docstring") OT::LogisticFactory::buildAsLogistic
"Estimate the distribution as native distribution.


**Available usages**:

    buildAsLogistic()

    buildAsLogistic(*sample*)

    buildAsLogistic(*param*)

Parameters
----------
sample : 2-d sequence of float
    Sample from which the distribution parameters are estimated.
param : sequence of float
   The parameters of the :class:`~openturns.Logistic`.

Returns
-------
distribution : :class:`~openturns.Logistic`
    The estimated distribution as a Logistic.
    
    In the first usage, the default Logistic distribution is built."
