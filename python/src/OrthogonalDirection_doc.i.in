%feature("docstring") OT::OrthogonalDirection
"Sampling following the orthogonal direction strategy.

Available constructor:
    OrthogonalDirection()

    OrthogonalDirection(*dimension, k*)

Parameters
----------
dimension : integer
    The dimension of the standard space. By default, :math:`dimension = 0` but
    automatically updated by the calling class.
k : int
    The number of elements in the linear combinations. By default,
    :math:`k = 1` but automatically updated by the calling class.

RandomDirection

Notes
-----
This strategy is parameterized by :math:`k \in \{1, \ldots, n\}`, where *n* is
the dimension of the input random vector :math:`\vect{X}`. We generate one
direct orthonormalized basis :math:`(e_1, \ldots, e_n)` uniformly distributed in
the set of direct orthonormal bases. We consider all the normalized linear
combinations of *k* vectors chosen within the *n* vectors of the basis, where
the coefficients of the linear combinations are in :math:`\{+1, -1\}`. This
generates :math:`\binom{k}{n} 2^k` new vectors :math:`v_i`. We sample according
to all the directions defined by the vectors :math:`v_i`.

If :math:`k = 1`, we consider all the axes of the standard space."
