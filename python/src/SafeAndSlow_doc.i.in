%feature("docstring") OT::SafeAndSlow
"SafeAndSlow method.

Parameters
----------
solver : :class:`~openturns.Solver`
    Non linear solver used to research the intersection of the limit state
    function with the direction, on each segment of length *stepSize*, between
    the center of the space and *maximumDistance* (root research).
maximumDistance : positive float
    Distance from the center of the standard space until which we research an
    intersection with the limit state function along each direction. By
    default, the maximum distance is equal to the value defined through the key
    RootStrategyImplementation-DefaultMaximumDistance of the
    :class:`~openturns.ResourceMap`.
stepSize : float
    Length of each segment inside which the root research is performed. By
    default, the step size is equal to the value defined through the key
    RootStrategyImplementation-DefaultStepSize of the
    :class:`~openturns.ResourceMap`.

Notes
-----
The *SafeAndSlow* strategy is the following: for each direction, we go along
the direction by step of length *stepSize* from the origin to the maximum
distant point(at distance *maximumDistance* from the center of the standard
space) and we check whether there is a sign changement on each segment so
formed.

We go until the maximum distant point. Then, for all the segments where we
detected the presence of a root, we research the root with the selected non
linear solver. We evaluate the contribution to the failure probability of each
segment.

If *stepSize* is small enough, this strategy guarantees us to find all the roots
in the direction and the contribution of this direction to the failure
probability is precisely evaluated."
