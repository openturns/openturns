"Maximum Entropy Order Statistics distribution.

Let :math:`\inputRV = (X_1, \dots, X_n)` be random vector which marginals are given and such that:

.. math::
    :label: orderConstraint

    X_1 \leq \dots \leq X_n \quad \mbox{almost surely}.

The class :class:`~openturns.MaximumEntropyOrderStatisticsDistribution` implements the
joint distribution of :math:`\inputRV` that maximizes the entropy of :math:`\inputRV`.
See [fischer2017]_ for more details.

The distribution of :math:`\inputRV` is the distribution of the random vector of the :math:`n`
order statistics of a scalar distribution :math:`Y`. We can write:

 .. math::
   (X_1, \dots, X_n) \sim (Y_{(1)}, \dots, Y_{(n)})

In that case, we do not know :math:`Y` but we fix the marginals of its order statistics distribution.

Note that if the :math:`X_i \sim \beta(i, n-i+1)`, then :math:`\inputRV` is
the joint distribution of the :math:`n` order statistics of :math:`Y \sim \cU([0,1])`.
It is implemented by the class :class:`~openturns.UniformOrderStatistics`.

The marginals of  :math:`\inputRV` must be compatible with the order constraint
:eq:`orderConstraint`. The library checks this compatibility by default. It requires that
if :math:`F_i` is the CDF of :math:`X_i`, we must have:

.. math::
    :label: orderConstraintCDF

    F_1 \geq F_2 \geq \dots \geq F_n

which implies that if :math:`[a_i, b_i]` is the numerical range of :math:`X_i`, then:

.. math::
    a_i \leq a_{i+1}\\
    b_i \leq b_{i+1}

If the marginal distributions do not verify this constraint, a message is sent at the creation of the class.

If :math:`f_i` is the cdf of :math:`X_i`, the pdf of :math:`\inputRV` is defined as:

.. math::

    f_\inputRV(x) = f_1(x_1) \prod\limits_{k=2}^n \phi_k(x_k) \exp\left(-\int_{x_{k-1}}
    ^{x_k} \phi_k(s)\di{s}\right) \mathbf{1}_{x_1 \leq \dots \leq x_d}

             \text{with } \phi_k(x_k) = \frac{f_k(x_k)}{F_{k-1}(x_k)-F_k(x_k)}

Parameters
----------
coll : sequence of :class:`~openturns.Distribution`
    The collection of the marginal distributions.
    
    Default collection is [Unif(-1.0, 0.5), Unif(-0.5, 1.0)].
useApproximation : bool
    Indicates whether the expression :math:`\Phi_k(t)` is approximated with a polynomials (Hermitte with degree 4 on a discretization determined by a Gauss-Kronrod algorithm applied to :math:`\Phi_k(t)`).

    By default, the approximation is used.
checkMarginals : bool
    Indicates whether the compatibility tests on the marginals is done.

    By default, the tests are done.

Notes
-----
We note:

.. math::

    \Phi_k(t) = \exp\left(-\int_{a_{k}}^{t} \phi_k(s)\di{s}\right)

The exponential factor :math:`\Phi_k(t)` might be expensive to compute at any value
:math:`t`. It can be replaced by a piecewise Hermite approximation using the
following keys in :class:`~openturns.ResourceMap`:

* 'MaximumEntropyOrderStatisticsDistribution-UseApproximation': if set to *True*, the approximation is built. The default value is *False*;
* 'MaximumEntropyOrderStatisticsDistribution-SupportShift': a shift to avoid the discontinuities in :math:`\Phi_k(t)`. Its default value is *1e-15*;
* 'MaximumEntropyOrderStatisticsDistribution-ExponentialFactorDiscretization': the maximum size of the adaptive discretization used to detect discontinuities using a 7/15 points Gauss-Kronrod integration method. Default value is *100*, which should give an absolute error of order *1e-8* for the approximation with no subdivision.
* 'MaximumEntropyOrderStatisticsDistribution-MaximumApproximationSubdivision': each interval of the adapted grid is subdivided into a regular grid of this size to improve the accuracy. Default value is *2*, giving an absolute error of order *1e-9*.

The approximation should be used *with caution*. There is no easy quantitative criterion to guide the choice, but either it works with a high degree of precision, or it fails producing negative values for the exponential factor. It occurs when two marginal distributions have almost the same range, eg two uniform distributions with range [0,1] and [0.038, 1.038].

Examples
--------
Create a distribution which components are ordered almost surely:

>>> import openturns as ot
>>> coll = [ot.Uniform(-1.0, 1.0), ot.LogUniform(1.0, 1.2), ot.Triangular(3.0, 4.0, 5.0)]
>>> distribution = ot.MaximumEntropyOrderStatisticsDistribution(coll)

Draw a sample:

>>> sample = distribution.getSample(5)"
