"Chebychev specific orthonormal univariate polynomial family.

For the :class:`~openturns.Arcsine` distribution.

Notes
-----
Any sequence of orthogonal polynomials has a recurrence formula relating any
three consecutive polynomials as follows:

.. math::

    P_{i + 1} = (a_i x + b_i) P_i + c_i P_{i - 1}, \quad i > 0

The recurrence coefficients for the Chebychev polynomials come analytically and
read :math:`a_0=\sqrt{2}, b_0=0, c_0=0`, :math:`a_1=2, b_1=0,c_1=-\sqrt{2}` and for :math:`i>1`, :math:`a_i=2, b_i=0, c_i=-1`.
