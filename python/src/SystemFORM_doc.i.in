%feature("docstring") OT::SystemFORM
"Approximation algorithm for system events based on FORM.

Each event :math:`E_i` is represented by its reliability index :math:`\beta_i`
and the hyperplane defined by the :math:`\vect{\alpha_i}` normal coefficients obtained via
a preliminary FORM approximation.

For an union (series systems) the probability writes:

.. math::

    P(E_{sys}) = P(\bigcup_{i=1}^N E_i) = 1 - \Phi_k (\vect{\beta}; \vect{\vect{\rho}})

where :math:`\vect{\vect{\rho}}_{i,j} = \vect{\alpha_i}^T\vect{\alpha_j}`

For an intersection (parallel system) the probability writes:

.. math::

    P(\bigcap_{i=1}^N E_i) = \Phi_k (-\vect{\beta}; \vect{\vect{\rho}})

In practice the event has to be defined under its disjonctive normal form
(union of intersections).
Each probability of intersection region is computed using the previous formula,
then the Poincare formula is used to combine each union:

.. math::

    P(E_{sys}) = P(\bigcup_{i=1}^N E_i) = \sum_{i=1}^N P(E_i) - \sum_{i < j} P(E_i \cap E_j) + \dots + (-1)^N P(E_1 \cap E_2 \cap \dots \cap E_N)

More details can be found in [lemaire2009]_, at the chapter *Reliability of systems*.

Parameters
----------
solver : :class:`~openturns.OptimizationAlgorithm`
    Optimization algorithm used to research the design point.
event : :class:`~openturns.RandomVector`
    Failure system event, in disjunctive normal form
    (either a union of intersections, or a single intersection)
physicalStartingPoint : sequence of float
    Starting point of the optimization algorithm, declared in the physical
    space.
limitStateTolerance : float (optional)
    Tolerance on limit state function to assess if the found design point can be used 
    to estimate failure probability. Default value is defined in :class:`~openturns.ResourceMap` of  class :class:`~openturns.Analytical`.
    

Notes
-----
As a leaf event may appear several times in the system event tree, and as a
FORM calculus is run for each unique leaf event, there may be less items in the
FORM results collection (returned by :meth:`~openturns.MultiFORMResult.getFORMResultCollection`) than leaf events.

Examples
--------
>>> import openturns as ot
>>> dim = 2
>>> X = ot.RandomVector(ot.Normal(dim))
>>> e1 = ot.ThresholdEvent(ot.CompositeRandomVector(ot.SymbolicFunction(['x1', 'x2'], ['(x1+2*x2)^2']), X), ot.Greater(), 5.0)
>>> e2 = ot.ThresholdEvent(ot.CompositeRandomVector(ot.SymbolicFunction(['x1', 'x2'], ['(x2+3*x1)^2']), X), ot.Greater(), 5.0)
>>> event = ot.IntersectionEvent([e1, e2])
>>> solver = ot.AbdoRackwitz()
>>> starting_pt = [0.1] * dim
>>> algo = ot.SystemFORM(solver, event, starting_pt)
>>> algo.run()
>>> result = algo.getResult()
>>> form_results = result.getFORMResultCollection()
>>> pf = result.getEventProbability()"
