%feature("docstring") OT::FixedExperiment
"Fixed experiment.

Parameters
----------
aSample : 2-d sequence of float
    Sample that already exists.
weights : sequence of float, optional
    Weights of each point of *aSample*.

Notes
-----
FixedExperiment is a deterministic weighted design of experiments.
It enables to take into account a random sample which has been obtained outside
the study or at another step of the study.
The :meth:`generate` method always gives the same sample, *aSample*, if it is
recalled. When not specified, the weights associated to the points are all
equal to :math:`1/cardI`. Then the sample *aSample* is considered as generated
from the limit distribution
:math:`\lim\limits_{cardI \to \infty} \sum_{i \in I} \omega_i \delta_{\vect{X}_i}=\mu`.
The :meth:`setDistribution` method has no side effect, as the distribution is
fixed by the initial sample.
