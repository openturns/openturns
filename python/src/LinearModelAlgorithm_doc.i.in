%feature("docstring") OT::LinearModelAlgorithm
"Class used to create a linear model from numerical samples.

**Available usages**:

    LinearModelAlgorithm(Xsample, Ysample)

    LinearModelAlgorithm(Xsample, basis, Ysample)

Parameters
----------
XSample : 2-d sequence of float
    The input samples of a model.

YSample : 2-d sequence of float
    The output samples of a model, must be of dimension 1.

basis : :class:`~openturns.Basis`
    The :math:`\phi` basis .

--------
LinearModelResult

Notes
-----
This class is used in order to create a linear model from data samples. The
linear regression model between the scalar variable :math:`Y` and the :math:`n`
-dimensional vector :math:`\vect{X} = (X_i)_{i \leq n}` writes as follows:

.. math::

    \tilde{Y} = \sum_{i=0}^p a_i \phi_i(X) + \epsilon

where :math:`\epsilon` is the residual, supposed to follow the standard Normal
distribution, :math:`\phi` a functional basis.
The algorithm class enables to estimate the coefficients of the linear expansion.

If basis is not specified, the underlying model is :

.. math::

    \tilde{Y} = a_0 + \sum_{i=1}^n a_i X_i + \epsilon

The coefficients :math:`a_i` are evaluated using a least squares method. Default
 method is `QR`. User might choose also `SVD` or `Cholesky` (usefull if basis
 is orthogonal) and large dataset.

The evaluation of the coefficients is completed by some usefull parameters that could
help the diagnostic of the linearity."
