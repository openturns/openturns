OpenTURNS is a scientific C++ and Python library including an internal data model and algorithms
dedicated to the treatment of uncertainties. The main goal of this library is giving
to specific applications all the functionalities needed to treat uncertainties in studies.
Targeted users are all engineers who want to introduce the probabilistic dimension
in their so far deterministic studies.
