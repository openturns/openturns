"Linear basis factory.

The linear basis is composed of the linear terms of the canonical basis:

.. math::

    \{ \psi_k(x) \} = \{ 1, x_1, \hdots, x_n \}

Parameters
----------
dimension : integer
    Input dimension of the basis.

Examples
--------
>>> import openturns as ot
>>> basis = LinearBasisFactory(2).build()
>>> f = ot.AggregatedFunction(basis)
>>> x = [2, 3]
>>> print(f(x))
[1,2,3]"
