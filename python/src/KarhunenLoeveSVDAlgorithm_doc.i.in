Notes
-----
The Karhunen-Loeve SVD algorithm solves the Fredholm problem  associated to the
covariance function :math:`C`: see :class:`~openturns.KarhunenLoeveAlgorithm`
to get the notations.
If the mesh is regular, then this decomposition is equivalent to the principal
component analysis (PCA) (see [pearson1907]_, [hotelling1933]_, [jackson1991]_, [jolliffe2002]_).
In other fields such as computational fluid dynamics for example,
this is called the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) (see [luo2018]_).

The SVD approach is a particular case of the quadrature approach (see
:class:`~openturns.KarhunenLoeveQuadratureAlgorithm`)  where we consider the
functional basis  :math:`((\vect{\theta}_p^j(\vect{s}))_{1 \leq j \leq d, 1 \leq p \leq P}` of
:math:`L^2(\cD, \Rset^d)` defined on :math:`\cD` by:

.. math:: 

    \vect{\theta}_p^j(\vect{s})= \left[\mat{C}(\vect{s}, \vect{s}_p) \right]_{:, j}

The SVD approach is used when the covariance function is not explicitly known but only
through :math:`K` fields of the associated stochastic process :math:`\vect{X}`: :math:`(\vect{X}_1, \dots, \vect{X}_K)`.

It consists in :

    - approximating :math:`\mat{C}` by its empirical estimator
      :math:`\dfrac{1}{\tilde{K}} \tilde{\mat{X}}\, \Tr{\tilde{\mat{X}}}` where
      :math:`\tilde{\mat{X}}~=~(\vect{X}_1 | \dots | \vect{X}_K)` and :math:`\tilde{K}=K`
      if the process is centered and :math:`\tilde{\mat{X}}~=~(\vect{X}_1 - \vect{\mu} | \dots | \vect{X}_K - \vect{\mu})`:math:`\tilde{K}=K-1`
      otherwise, where :math:`\vect{\mu}=\dfrac{1}{K}\sum_{k=1}^K\vect{X}_k`;
    - taking the :math:`L` vertices of the mesh of :math:`\vect{X}` as the :math:`L` quadrature points.

We suppose now that :math:`K < dL`, and we note :math:`\mat{Y} = \sqrt{\mat{W}} \,\mat{X}`.

As the matrix :math:`\mat{\Theta} = \mat{C}` is invertible, the Galerkin and collocation
approaches are equivalent and both lead to the following singular value problem for :math:`\mat{Y}`:

.. math::
    :label: QuadCollDim1_ter

     \mat{Y}\,\Tr{\mat{Y}}\,\mat{\Psi}_k  & = \tilde{K} \lambda_k \mat{\Psi}_k

The SVD decomposition of :math:`\mat{Y}\in \mathcal{M}_{dL,\tilde{K}}(\Rset)` writes:

.. math::

    \mat{Y} = \mat{U}\, \mat{\Sigma} \, \Tr{\mat{V}}

where  we have :math:`\mat{U} \in \mathcal{M}_{dL,\tilde{K}}(\Rset)`, 
:math:`\mat{\Sigma}\in \mathcal{M}_{\tilde{K},\tilde{K}}(\Rset)`, :math:`\mat{V} \in \mathcal{M}_{\tilde{K},\tilde{K}}(\Rset)` such that :

    - :math:`\Tr{\mat{V}}\mat{V} =\mat{V}\Tr{\mat{V}}= \mat{I}_{\tilde{K}}`,  
    - :math:`\Tr{\mat{U}}\mat{U} = \mat{I}_{\tilde{K}}` ,
    - :math:`\mat{\Sigma} = diag(\sigma_1, \dots, \sigma_{\tilde{K}})`.

Then the columns of :math:`\mat{U}` are the eigenvectors of :math:`\mat{Y}\Tr{\mat{Y}}`
associated to the eigenvalues :math:`\sigma_k^2`.

We deduce the modes and eigenvalues of the Fredholm problem for :math:`k \leq \tilde{K}`:

.. math::

    \begin{align*}
      \mat{\Phi}_k = \dfrac{1}{\lambda_k} \sqrt{\mat{W}}\, \mat{U}_k
      \lambda_k = \dfrac{\sigma_k^2}{\tilde{K}}
    \end{align*}

We have:

.. math::

    \tilde{\vect{\varphi}}_k(\vect{t})= \sum_{\ell=1}^L  C(\vect{t}, \vect{\xi}_\ell) \vect{\phi}_{\ell,k} \quad \mbox{pour} \quad k \leq \tilde{K}

The most computationally intensive part of the algorithm is the computation of the
SVD decomposition. By default, it is done using LAPACK dgesdd routine. While being
very accurate and reasonably fast for small to medium sized problems, it becomes
prohibitively slow for large cases. The user can choose to use a stochastic
algorithm instead, with the constraint that the number of singular values to be
computed has to be fixed a priori.
The following keys of :class:`~openturns.ResourceMap` allow one to select and tune
these algorithms:

    - 'KarhunenLoeveSVDAlgorithm-UseRandomSVD' which triggers the use of a random
      algorithm. By default, it is set to *False* and LAPACK is used.
    - 'KarhunenLoeveSVDAlgorithm-RandomSVDMaximumRank' which fixes the number of
      singular values to compute. By default it is set to 1000.	
    - 'KarhunenLoeveSVDAlgorithm-RandomSVDVariant' which can be equal to either
      'halko2010' for [halko2010]_ (the default) or 'halko2011' for [halko2011]_.
      These two algorithms have very similar structures, the first one being based
      on a random compression of both the rows and columns of :math:`\mat{Y}`, the
      second one being based on an iterative compressed sampling of the columns of
      :math:`\mat{Y}`.
    - 'KarhunenLoeveSVDAlgorithm-halko2011Margin' and
      'KarhunenLoeveSVDAlgorithm-halko2011Iterations' to fix the parameters of the
      'halko2011' variant. See [halko2011]_ for the details.
