"LOLA-Voronoi sequential design algorithm.

.. warning::
    This class is experimental and likely to be modified in future releases.
    To use it, import the ``openturns.experimental`` submodule.

This class implements the design of experiments algorithm described in [crombecq2011]_ which allows one
to sequentially generate new input samples according to the input measure and model output.
It combines an exploration criterion based on Voronoi tesselation to identify
undersampled input design regions and an exploitation criterion based on a measure
of the nonlinearity of the model.

Lets define a random vector :math:`\vect{X}` with measure :math:`\inputMeasure(\vect{x})` and dimension :math:`d`,
:math:`\sampleSize` initial points :math:`\vect{p}_i, \forall i \in [1,\sampleSize]` and a model :math:`\model`.

The exploration criterion score of the point :math:`\vect{p}_i` is equal to the probability of its Voronoi cell,
which can be written as:

.. math::

    v(\vect{p}_i)
    &= \int_{\vect{x} \in \mathcal{V}_i} \inputMeasure(\vect{x}) d\vect{x} \\
    &= \Expect{1_{\mathcal{V}_i}(\vect{X})}

for :math:`i \in\{1, ..., \sampleSize\}` where :math:`\sampleSize` is the sample size and :math:`1_{\mathcal{V}_i}`
is the indicator function of the `i`-th Voronoi cell:

.. math::
    1_{\mathcal{V}_i}(\vect{x}) = 
    \begin{cases}
    1 & \textrm{ if } \vect{x} \in \mathcal{V}_i \\
    0 & \textrm{otherwise.}
    \end{cases}

The Voronoi score is approximated using a Monte Carlo experiment.

For the nonlinearity criterion the algorithm only uses the data available and chooses a
set of neighbouring samples :math:`N(\vect{p}_i) = \{\vect{p}_{i1}, \hdots, \vect{p}_{im}\}`
with :math:`m = 2 d` to build the gradient approximation of the model :math:`\model`
at the point :math:`\vect{p}_i`, denoted by :math:`\mat{J}_i`.

The LOLA algorithm local nonlinearity score of the point :math:`\vect{p}_{r}` is the cumulated error between the model
and the linear approximation built from its neighbourhood.
For each component :math:`\model_k` of the model, the local nonlinearity score is given by:

.. math::

    e_k(\vect{p}_r) = \sum_{i=1}^m | \model_k(\vect{p}_{ri}) - (\model_k(\vect{p}_r) + \mat{J}_i(\vect{p}_{ri} - \vect{p}_r)) |

for :math:`i \in \{1, ..., \sampleSize\}` where :math:`\model` is the model
and :math:`\model(\vect{p}_{r}) + \mat{J}_i (\vect{p}_{ri} - \vect{p}_{r})`
is its linear approximation in the neighbourhood of the point :math:`\vect{p}_{r}`.

In order to aggregate all the :math:`e_k(\vect{p}_r) \forall k \in [1, d_Y]`, we can use two different norms:

.. math::

    e(\vect{p}_r) = \frac{1}{d_Y} \sum_{k=1}^{d_Y} e_k(\vect{p}_r)

or

.. math::

    e(\vect{p}_r) = \max_{k=1, .. d_Y} e_k(\vect{p}_r)

Now the two metrics are combined into the hybrid score given by:

.. math::

    h(\vect{p}_i) = \lambda v(\vect{p}_i) + (1 - \lambda) \frac{e(\vect{p}_i)}{\sum_{j=1}^n e(\vect{p}_j)}

for :math:`i \in \{1, ..., \sampleSize\}`, with :math:`\lambda` a tradeoff coefficient.

To generate a new point, random points are generated by Monte Carlo close to
the reference point :math:`\vect{p}_i` with highest hybrid score.
The new point is selected among the generated sample inside the Voronoi cell of :math:`\vect{p}_i`
and farthest away from :math:`\vect{p}_i` and its neighbours.
To generate a batch of :math:`n_{new}` points this procedure is repeated on the :math:`n_{new}`
reference points with highest hybrid score taking into account the voronoi cells of the new candidates.

Parameters
----------
x : 2-d sequence of float
    Initial input sample
y : 2-d sequence of float
    Initial output sample
distribution : :class:`~openturns.Distribution`
    Distribution to generate new input samples

Notes
-----
Various :class:`~openturns.ResourceMap` entries allow for a more fine-grained control over the algorithm:

- The entry `LOLAVoronoi-DefaultNeighbourhoodCandidatesNumber` defines the number of extra closest neighbours
  around each reference point to consider for selection of the neighbourhood with greatest combined score used for the LOLA criterion.
- The entry `LOLAVoronoi-DefaultVoronoiSamplingSize` controls the sampling size used
  to estimate the Voronoi cells relative volume or generate new candidates.
- The entry `LOLAVoronoi-MaximumCombinationsNumber` controls the maximum
  number of existing point subsets will be tested to get the best neighbourhood for the exploitation criterion.
- The entry `LOLAVoronoi-UseTruncatedDistribution` controls the way the :math:`\inputMeasure(\vect{x})` distribution is truncated
  to the bounding box `B` of the Voronoi cell being sampled.
  If the flag is set to False, the sampling is done by a rejection method with respect to :math:`\inputMeasure(\vect{x})` and `B`.
  The advantage is to avoid the expensive computation of the normalization factor of the truncation of :math:`\inputMeasure(\vect{x})`.
  The drawback is that the acceptation rate might be low.
  If the flag is set to True, the truncated distribution of :math:`\inputMeasure(\vect{x})` to `B` is explicitly built and sampled.
  The advantage is to possibly use the CDF inversion method to sample this truncated distribution: all the points are accepted.
  But the CDF inversion method is only available if the copula of :math:`\inputMeasure(\vect{x})` is the independent one:
  otherwise a rejection method is used and the advantage of this option is lost.
  The drawback is the automatic computation of the normalization factor of the truncation of :math:`\inputMeasure(\vect{x})`
  which is used only if the CDF inversion method is used.
  As a result, the default value is False.
- The string entry `LOLAVoronoi-NonLinearityAggregationMethod` controls how the non-linearity score is computed
  across multiple outputs from the gradient vectors: either `Maximum` (default) to distinguish the most nonlinear regions
  or `Average` that will smooth the score but can be a good alternative when there are only a few outputs.
- The string entry `LOLAVoronoi-DecompositionMethod` selects the least-squares method to compute the gradient.
- The float entry `LOLAVoronoi-HybridScoreTradeoff` is the value of the tradeoff coefficient :math:`\lambda`.

Examples
--------
>>> import openturns as ot
>>> import openturns.experimental as otexp
>>> formula = '-4 * exp((-25 / 8) * (a0^2 + a1^2)) + 7 * exp((-125 / 4) * (a0^2 + a1^2))'
>>> f1 = ot.SymbolicFunction(['a0', 'a1'], [formula])
>>> distribution = ot.JointDistribution([ot.Uniform(-1.0, 1.0)] * 2)
>>> x0 = ot.LowDiscrepancyExperiment(ot.HaltonSequence(), distribution, 10).generate()
>>> y0 = f1(x0)
>>> algo = otexp.LOLAVoronoi(x0, y0, distribution)

Now add 2 blocks of 3 points:

>>> for i in range(2):
...     x = algo.generate(3)
...     y = f1(x)
...     algo.update(x, y)
