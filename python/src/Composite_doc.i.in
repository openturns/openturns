%feature("docstring") OT::Composite
"Composite design of experiments.

Available constructor:
    Composite(*center, levels*)

    Composite(*dimension, levels*)

Parameters
----------
center : sequence of float
    Center of the design of experiments. If not specified, the design of
    experiments is centered on :math:`\vect{0} \in \Rset^n`.
levels : sequence of float of dimension :math:`n_{level}`
    The discretization of directions (the same for each one), without any
    consideration of unit.
dimension : positive int
    Dimension :math:`n` of the space where the design of experiments is created.

Notes
-----
Composite is a stratified design of experiments enabling to create a pattern
as the union of an :class:`~openturns.Axial` pattern and a
:class:`~openturns.Factorial` one. The number of points generated is
:math:`1 + n_{level}(2n+2^n)`.

In order to scale each direction and translate the grid structure onto the
proper center, use the operator :math:`*=` and :math:`+=` of
:class:`~openturns.Sample`.

Examples
--------
>>> import openturns as ot
>>> levels = [4.0, 2.0, 7.0]
>>> myCenteredReductedGrid = ot.Composite(2, levels)
>>> mySample = myCenteredReductedGrid.generate()
>>> # Translate the grid
>>> mySample+=4
>>> # Scale each direction
>>> mySample*=2"
