%feature("docstring") OT::BinomialFactory
"Binomial factory.

Notes
-----
The estimation is done by maximizing the likelihood of the sample.

| We initialize the value of :math:`(n,p_n)` to
  :math:`\displaystyle\left(\left\lceil\frac{\Hat{x}_n^2}{\Hat{x}_n-\Hat{\sigma}_n^2}\right\rceil, \frac{\Hat{x}_n}{n}\right)`
  where :math:`\Hat{x}_n` is the empirical mean of the sample
  :math:`(x_1, \hdots, x_n)`, and :math:`\Hat{\sigma}_n^2` its unbiaised
  empirical variance.
| Then, we evaluate the likelihood of the sample with respect to the
  Binomial distribution parameterized with
  :math:`\displaystyle\left(\left\lceil\frac{\Hat{x}_n^2}{\Hat{x}_n-\Hat{\sigma}_n^2}\right\rceil, \frac{\Hat{x}_n}{n}\right)`.
  By testing successively :math:`n+1` and :math:`n-1` instead of
  :math:`n`, we determine the variation of the likelihood of the sample
  with respect to the Binomial distribution parameterized with
  :math:`(n+1,p_{n+1})` and :math:`(n-1,p_{n-1})`. We then iterate in
  the direction that makes the likelihood decrease, until the likelihood
  stops decreasing. The last couple is the one selected.

%feature("docstring") OT::BinomialFactory::buildAsBinomial
"Estimate the distribution as native distribution.

**Available usages**:

    buildAsBinomial()

    buildAsBinomial(*sample*)

    buildAsBinomial(*param*)

Parameters
----------
sample : 2-d sequence of float
    Sample from which the distribution parameters are estimated.
param : sequence of float
   The parameters of the :class:`~openturns.Binomial`.

Returns
-------
distribution : :class:`~openturns.Binomial`
    The estimated distribution as a Binomial.
    
    In the first usage, the default Binomial distribution is built."
