%feature("docstring") OT::KernelSmoothing
"Non parametric continuous distribution estimation by kernel smoothing.

Refer to :ref:`kernel_smoothing`.

Parameters
----------
kernel : :class:`~openturns.Distribution`, optional
    Univariate distribution of the kernel that will be used. By default, the standard Normal distribution is used. 
binned : bool, optional
    Activates bining mechanism only in the univariate or bivariate cases. It allows one to speed up the manipulation of the density function of the resulting distribution.  By default, the mechanism is activated.
binNumber : int, :math:`binNumber \geq 2`, optional
    Indicates the number of bins used by the bining mechanism. By default, OpenTURNS uses the values stored in the *ResourceMap*.
boundaryCorrection : bool, optional
    Activates the boundary correction using the mirroring technique.
    By default, the correction is not provided.

Notes
-----
The binning mechanism creates a regular grid of *binNumber* intervals in each
dimension, then the unit weight of each point is linearly affected to the vertices
of the bin containing the point. See [wand1994]_ for the details.

The boundary correction is available only in one dimension, and it is done using
the mirroring technique. See the notes of the :meth:`setBoundingOption` method for
details.

When applied to multivariate samples, the kernel is the kernel product of the
univariate distribution specified in the constructor.

Examples
--------
Fit a distribution on data thanks to the kernel smoothing technique:

>>> import openturns as ot
>>> ot.RandomGenerator.SetSeed(0)
>>> sample = ot.Gamma(6.0, 1.0).getSample(100)
>>> ks = ot.KernelSmoothing()
>>> fittedDist = ks.build(sample)
>>> print(fittedDist.getClassName())
Distribution

The :meth:`build` method produces a generic :class:`~openturns.Distribution`
object. Other build methods (detailed below) produce more specific objects.

Get the bandwidth:

>>> bandwidth = ks.getBandwidth()
>>> print(bandwidth)
[0.862207]

The bandwidth was guessed by the :meth:`build` method.
It could also have been provided by the user.

>>> bandwidth = [0.9]
>>> fittedDist = ks.build(sample, bandwidth)

Compare the PDFs:

>>> graph = fittedDist.drawPDF()
>>> graph.add( ot.Gamma(6.0, 1.0).drawPDF())
>>> graph.setColors(ot.Drawable.BuildDefaultPalette(2))
>>> graph.setLegends(['KS dist', 'Gamma'])

The default values of the parameters of the constructor usually provide good results.
Nevertheless, the parameters can be manually set.

>>> kernel = ot.Uniform()
>>> ks = ot.KernelSmoothing(kernel)
>>> binned = True # by default True
>>> binNumber = 64
>>> ks = ot.KernelSmoothing(kernel, binned, binNumber)
>>> boundaryCorrection = True # by default False
>>> ks = ot.KernelSmoothing(kernel, binned, binNumber, boundaryCorrection)

Variants of the :meth:`build` method can be used when the distribution to build
is expected to be of a certain type. In those cases however,
the bandwidth must be user-specified.
To use :meth:`buildAsTruncatedDistribution`, boundary correction must be enabled.

>>> distribution = ks.buildAsKernelMixture(sample, bandwidth)
>>> print(distribution.getClassName())
KernelMixture
>>> distribution = ks.buildAsMixture(sample, bandwidth)
>>> print(distribution.getClassName())
Mixture
>>> distribution = ks.buildAsTruncatedDistribution(sample, bandwidth)
>>> print(distribution.getClassName())
TruncatedDistribution"

"Fit a kernel smoothing distribution on data.

Parameters
----------
sample : 2-d sequence of float,
    Data on which the distribution is fitted. Any dimension.

%feature("docstring") OT::KernelSmoothing::build
"Fit a kernel smoothing distribution on data.

Parameters
----------
sample : 2-d sequence of float
    Data on which the distribution is fitted. Any dimension.
bandwidth : :class:`~openturns.Point`, optional
    Contains the bandwidth in each direction. If not specified, the bandwidth is calculated using the mixed rule from data.

Returns
-------
fittdDist : :class:`~openturns.Distribution`
    The fitted distribution.

Notes
-----
According to the dimension of the data and the specified treatments, the resulting distribution differs.

- If the sample is constant, a :class:`~openturns.Dirac` distribution is built.
- If dimension > 2 or if no treatment has been asked for, a :class:`~openturns.KernelMixture` is built by calling *buildAsKernelMixture*. 
- If dimension = 1 and a boundary treatment has been asked for, a :class:`~openturns.TruncatedDistribution` is built by calling *buildAsTruncatedDistribution*
- If dimension = 1 or 2 and no boundary treatment has been asked for, but a binning treatment has been asked for,

    - If the sample size is greater than the bin number, then a :class:`~openturns.Mixture` is built by calling `buildAsMixture`
    - Otherwise a :class:`~openturns.KernelMixture` is built by calling `buildAsKernelMixture`
    
The bandwidth selection depends on the dimension.

- If dimension = 1, then `computeMixedBandwidth` is used.
- Otherwise, then the only multivariate rule `computeSilvermanBandwidth` is used.

Examples
--------
See the effect of the boundary correction:

>>> import openturns as ot
>>> sample = ot.Exponential(1.0).getSample(1000)
>>> smoother = ot.KernelSmoothing()
>>> fittedDistNoCorr = smoother.build(sample)
>>> smoother.setBoundaryCorrection(True)
>>> fittedDistWithCorr = smoother.build(sample)

Compare the PDFs:

>>> graph = ot.Exponential(1.0).drawPDF()
>>> graph.add(fittedDistNoCorr.drawPDF())
>>> graph.add(fittedDistWithCorr.drawPDF())
>>> graph.setColors(['black', 'blue', 'red'])
>>> graph.setLegends(['Exp dist', 'No boundary corr', 'Boundary corr'])

Notes
-----
The possible values for the bounding option are:

Notes
-----
This method automatically sets the *automaticLowerBound* flag to *False*.
The given value will be taken into account only if *boundingOption* is set to
either 1 or 3. If the algorithm is applied to a sample with a minimum value
less than the user-defined lower bound and the *automaticLowerBound* is set to

Notes
-----
This method automatically sets the *automaticLowerBound* flag to *False*.

%feature("docstring") OT::KernelSmoothing::computeSilvermanBandwidth
"Compute the bandwidth according to the Silverman rule.

Returns
-------
bandwidth : :class:`~openturns.Point`
    Bandwidth which components are evaluated according to the Silverman rule assuming a normal distribution. The bandwidth uses a robust estimate of the sample standard deviation, based on the interquartile range (rather than the standard deviation of the distribution and the sample). This method can manage a multivariate sample and produces a multivariate bandwidth.
"

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
%feature("docstring") OT::KernelSmoothing::computePluginBandwidth
"Compute the bandwidth according to the plugin rule.

Returns
-------
bandwidth : :class:`~openturns.Point`
    Bandwidth which components are evaluated according to the plugin rule.

Notes
-----
This plug-in method is based on the solve-the-equation rule from (Sheather, Jones, 1991).
This method can take a lot of time for large samples, as the cost is  quadratic with the sample size.

The `KernelSmoothing-CutOffPlugin` key of the :class:`~openturns.ResourceMap` controls
the accuracy of the approximation used to estimate the rugosity of the
second derivative of the distribution.
The default value ensures that terms in the sum which weight are lower than
4.e-6 are ignored, which can reduce the calculation in some situations.
The properties of the standard gaussian density are so that,
in order to make the computation exact, the value of the
`KernelSmoothing-CutOffPlugin` must be set to 39, but this may increase the
computation time."

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
%feature("docstring") OT::KernelSmoothing::computeMixedBandwidth
"Compute the bandwidth according to a mixed rule.

Returns
-------
bandwidth : :class:`~openturns.Point`
    Bandwidth which components are evaluated according to a mixed rule.

Notes
----- 
Use the plugin rule for small sample, estimate the ratio between the plugin rule and the Silverman rule on this small sample, and finally scale the Silverman bandwidth computed on the full sample with this ratio. The size of the small sample is based on the `KernelSmoothing-SmallSize` key of the `ResourceMap`.
