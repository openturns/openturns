%feature("docstring") OT::MediumSafe
"MediumSafe method.

Parameters
----------
solver : :class:`~openturns.Solver`
    Non linear solver used to research the intersection of the limit state
    function with the direction, on each segment of length *stepSize*, between
    the center of the space and *maximumDistance* (root research).
maximumDistance : positive float
    Distance from the center of the standard space until which we research an
    intersection with the limit state function along each direction. By
    default, the maximum distance is equal to the value defined through the key
    RootStrategyImplementation-DefaultMaximumDistance of the
    :class:`~openturns.ResourceMap`.
stepSize : float
    Length of each segment inside which the root research is performed. By
    default, the step size is equal to the value defined through the key
    RootStrategyImplementation-DefaultStepSize of the
    :class:`~openturns.ResourceMap`.

Notes
-----
The *MediumSafe* strategy is the following: for each direction, we go along the
direction by step of length *stepSize* from the origin to the maximum distant
point (at distance *maximumDistance* from the center of the standard space) and
we check whether there is a sign changement on each segment so formed.

At the first sign changement, we research one root in the concerned segment
with the selected non linear solver. Then, the segment
*[root, maximum distant point]* is considered within the failure space.

If *stepSize* is small enough, this strategy guarantees us to find the root which
is the nearest from the origin."
