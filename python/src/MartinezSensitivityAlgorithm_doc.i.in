%feature("docstring") OT::MartinezSensitivityAlgorithm
"Sensitivity analysis using Martinez method.

Available constructors:
    MartinezSensitivityAlgorithm(*inputDesign, outputDesign, N, computeSecondOrder*)

    MartinezSensitivityAlgorithm(*distribution, N, model, computeSecondOrder*)
    
    MartinezSensitivityAlgorithm(*experiment, model, computeSecondOrder*)

Parameters
----------
inputDesign : :class:`~openturns.Sample`
    Design for the evaluation of sensitivity indices, obtained
    thanks to the SobolIndicesAlgorithmImplementation.Generate method
outputDesign : :class:`~openturns.Sample`
    Design for the evaluation of sensitivity indices, obtained as the evaluation
    of a Function (model) on the previous inputDesign
distribution : :class:`~openturns.Distribution`
    Input probabilistic model.
    Should have independent copula
experiment : :class:`~openturns.WeightedExperiment`
    Experiment for the generation of two independent samples.
N : int
    Size of samples to generate
computeSecondOrder : bool
    If True, design that will be generated contains elements for the evaluation
    of second order indices.

Notes
-----
This class is concerned with analyzing the influence the random vector
:math:`\vect{X} = \left( X^1, \ldots, X^{n_X} \right)` has on a random variable
:math:`Y^k` which is being studied for uncertainty, by using the [Martinez2011]_
method for the evaluation of both first and total order indices.

These last ones are respectively given as follows:

.. math::

   \begin{array}{ccc}
   \hat{S_i} & = & \rho_n(G(B), G(E^i)) \\
   \hat{ST_i} & = & 1 - \rho_n(G(A), G(E^i)) \\
   \end{array}

where :math:`\rho_n` is the empirical correlation defined by:

.. math::

   \rho_n(X, Y) = \frac{\Cov{X,Y}}{\sqrt{\Var{X} \Var{Y}}}

The class provides also the evaluation of asymptotic confidence interval for first
and total order indices, relying on the Fisher transformation.

This could be performed for gaussian output data. The
`MartinezSensitivityAlgorithm-UseAsmpytoticInterval` resource map key should
be fixed to True in that case.
