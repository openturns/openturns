"Hamming filtering windows.

Notes
-----
The Hamming windows is implemented using the formula:

.. math::

    w(t) =  C(\alpha - (1-\alpha)\cos(2\pi t))\fcar{[0,1]}{t}

with :math:`C = \frac{1}{\alpha^2 + (1-\alpha)^2/2}` and :math:`\alpha=25/46`.

The value of :math:`\alpha` minimizes the amplitude of the first side lobe of its Fourier transform.

The normalization constant :math:`C` is such that :math:`\int_{0}^{1} w(t)^2\di{t} = 1`.
