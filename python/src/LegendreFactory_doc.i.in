%feature("docstring") OT::LegendreFactory
"Legendre specific orthonormal univariate polynomial family.

For the :class:`~openturns.Uniform` distribution.

Notes
-----
Any sequence of orthogonal polynomials has a recurrence formula relating any
three consecutive polynomials as follows:

.. math::

    P_{i + 1} = (a_i x + b_i) P_i + c_i P_{i - 1}, \quad 1 < i

The recurrence coefficients for the Legendre polynomials come analytically and
read:

.. math::

    \begin{array}{rcl}
        a_i & = & \displaystyle \frac{\sqrt{(2 i + 1) (2 i + 3)}}
                                     {i + 1} \\
        b_i & = & 0 \\
        c_i & = & \displaystyle - \frac{i \sqrt{2 i + 3}}
                                       {(i + 1) \sqrt{2 i - 1}}
    \end{array}, \quad 1 < i
