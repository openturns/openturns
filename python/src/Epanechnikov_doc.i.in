"Epanechnikov distribution.

Notes
-----

Its probability density function is defined as:

.. math::

    f_X(x) = \frac{3}{4}\,(1 - x^2), \quad x \in [-1; 1]

It has no parameters and is intended to be used as a kernel within a
:class:`~openturns.KernelSmoothing`.

Its first moments are:

.. math::
    :nowrap:

    \begin{eqnarray*}
        \Expect{X} & = & 0 \\
        \Var{X} & = & \frac{1}{5}
    \end{eqnarray*}

Examples
--------
Create a distribution:

>>> import openturns as ot
>>> distribution = ot.Epanechnikov()

Draw a sample:

>>> sample = distribution.getSample(5)"
