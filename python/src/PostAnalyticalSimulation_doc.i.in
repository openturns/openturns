%feature("docstring") OT::PostAnalyticalSimulation
"Post analytical simulation.

See also
--------
PostAnalyticalImportanceSampling, PostAnalyticalControlledImportanceSampling

Notes
-----
This class inherits from Simulation.

The principle is to perform a simulation study to evaluate the threshold
exceedance probability according to an importance density centered around the
design point, in the standard space. The importance distribution is the standard
distribution of the standard space.

A PostAnalyticalSimulation object can be created only through its derivative
classes : :class:`~openturns.PostAnalyticalImportanceSampling` or
:class:`~openturns.PostAnalyticalControlledImportanceSampling`."

%feature("docstring") OT::PostAnalyticalSimulation::getAnalyticalResult
"Accessor to the analytical result.

Returns
-------
result : :class:`~openturns.AnalyticalResult`
    Result of the analytical study which has been performed just before the 
    simulation study centered around the importance factor."
