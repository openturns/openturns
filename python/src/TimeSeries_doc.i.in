%feature("docstring") OT::TimeSeries
"Time series.

Available constructors:
    TimeSeries(*nSteps,dim*)

    TimeSeries(*timeGrid, dim*)

    TimeSeries(*timeGrid, sample*)

    TimeSeries(*field*)

Parameters
----------
nSteps : int
    Enables to create a regular time grid on :math:`[0, nSteps]` which time step is equal to 1.

timeGrid : :class:`~openturns.RegularGrid`
    Regular time grid of the time series.

dim : int
    Dimension of the values of the time series at each time stamp. By default, the values are equal to the null vector.

sample : 2-d sequence of float
    Values assigned to each time stamp of the time series.

field : :class:`~openturns.Field`
    Maps a field into a time series when the associated lesh cn be interpretated as a regular time grid.

Examples
--------
Create a time series:

>>> import openturns as ot
>>> tmin = 0.0
>>> timeStep = 0.1
>>> n = 5
>>> myTimeGrid = ot.RegularGrid(tmin, timeStep, n)
>>> myValues = [[1.0], [2.0], [1.5], [4.5], [0.5]]
>>> myTimeSeries = ot.TimeSeries(myTimeGrid, myValues)

Draw the time series:

>>> graph = myTimeSeries.draw()"


// ---------------------------------------------------------------------

%feature("docstring") OT::TimeSeries::add
"Add a new value to the time series and extend the associated time grid.

Available usages:
    add(*sample*)

    add(*timeSeries*)

Parameters
----------
sample : 2-d sequence of float, of dimension the same as the dimension of the values of the time series.

timeSeries : :class:`~openturns.TimeSeries`, which time grid must match with the initial time grid (one follows the other).

Returns
-------
newTimeSeries : :class:`~openturns.TimeSeries`, whose regular grid has been extended with a new time stamp or a second time grid, associated to the new values.
