%feature("docstring") OT::Compact
"Compact history storage strategy.

Available constructors:
    Compact(*N*)

Parameters
----------
N : int
    minimum number of points to store.

See also
--------
HistoryStrategy, Null, Full, Last

Notes
-----
The compact strategy stores a regularly spaced sub-sample where the minimum size
of the stored numerical sample is :math:`N`. OpenTURNS proceeds as follows :

1. it stores the first :math:`2N` simulations : the size of the stored
   sample is :math:`2N`,
2. it selects only 1 out of 2 of the stored simulations : then the size of
   the stored sample decreases to :math:`N` (this is the *compact* step),
3. it stores the next :math:`N` simulations when selecting 1 out of 2 of the
   next simulations : the size of the stored sample is :math:`2N`,
4. it selects only 1 out of 2 of the stored simulations : then the size of
   the stored sample decreases to :math:`N`,
5. it stores the next :math:`N` simulations when selecting 1 out of 4 of the
   next simulations : the size of the stored sample is :math:`2N`,
6. then it keeps on until reaching the stopping criteria.

The stored numerical sample will have a size within :math:`N` and :math:`2N` if at least one cycle has been done, else it will be at most :math:`N`."
