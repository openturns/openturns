This document aims to give an overview of how to contribute to the development.
There are several ways to contribute.


Providing us with feedback on your own experience using the software is extremely
valuable for the other users as well as our developers. There exists many
channels for you to contact us:

  - We provide an `users <http://openturns.org/mailman/listinfo/users>`_ mailing list.
  - Bugs can be reported on our `bug tracker <https://github.com/openturns/openturns/issues>`_.
  - Once a year, one of the partners hosts the Users day which is a
    unique occasion for users to meet up and share their experience using the
    library.

.. warning::

    Please consider using the mailing list first if you have any doubt whether
    you have bumped into a real bug or not.
