A two degree-of-fredom primary/secondary damped oscillator
==========================================================

We consider a two degree-of-fredom primary-secondary damped oscillator.
This system is composed of a two-stage oscillator characterized by a mass, a stiffness and a damping ratio for each of the two oscillators.
This system is submitted to a white-noise excitation.
The limit-state function is highly nonlinear, mainly due to the interactions between the two stages of the system, and presents one failure zone.

    Two stage oscillator


The limit state function is defined as follows:

.. math:: G = F_s - 3 k_s \sqrt{\frac{\pi S_0}{4 \zeta_s \omega_s^3} \left[\frac{\zeta_a \zeta_s}{\zeta_p \zeta_s (4 \zeta_a^2 + \theta^2)+\gamma \zeta_a^2}\frac{(\zeta_p \omega_p^3 + \zeta_s \omega_s^3)\omega_p}{4 \zeta_a \omega_a^4}\right]}


The natural frequency of the first oscillator is equal to:

.. math:: \omega_p = \sqrt{\frac{k_p}{m_p}}

The natural frequency of the secondary oscillator is equal to:

.. math:: \omega_s = \sqrt{\frac{k_s}{m_s}}

The average natural frequency of the system is equal to:

.. math:: \omega_a = \frac{\omega_p+\omega_s}{2}

The average damping ratio of the system is equal to:

.. math:: \zeta_a = \frac{\zeta_p+\zeta_s}{2}

The mass ratio is equal to:

.. math:: \gamma = \frac{m_s}{m_p}

The tuning parameter of the system is equal to:

.. math:: \theta = \frac{\omega_p - \omega_s}{\omega_a}

Eight uncertainties are considered in the system:

- on the masses of the primary and secondary systems (:math:`m_p` and :math:`m_s`),
- on the spring stiffeness of the primary and secondary oscillators (:math:`k_p` and :math:`k_s`),
- on the damping ratios of the primary and secondary systems (:math:`\zeta_p` and :math:`\zeta_s`),
- on the loading capacity of the secondary spring (:math:`F_s`),
- on the intensity of the white noise excitation (:math:`S_0`).


We consider the following distribution fResponse of Two-Degree-of-Freedom Systems
to White-Noise Base Excitation:

- :math:`m_p \sim \text{LogNormalSigmaOverMu}(  \mu_{m_p} = 1.5, \delta_{m_p} = 0.1)`
- :math:`m_s \sim \text{LogNormalSigmaOverMu}(  \mu_{m_s} = 0.01,  \delta_{m_s} = 0.1)`
- :math:`k_p \sim \text{LogNormalSigmaOverMu}(  \mu_{k_p} = 1,  \delta_{k_p} = 0.2)`
- :math:`k_s \sim \text{LogNormalSigmaOverMu}(  \mu_{k_s} = 0.01,  \delta_{k_s} = 0.2)`
- :math:`\zeta_p \sim \text{LogNormalSigmaOverMu}(  \mu_{\zeta_p} = 0.05, \delta_{\zeta_p} = 0.4)`
- :math:`\zeta_s \sim \text{LogNormalSigmaOverMu}(  \mu_{\zeta_s} = 0.02,  \delta_{\zeta_s} = 0.5)`
- :math:`F_s \sim \text{LogNormalSigmaOverMu}(  \mu_{F_s} = 27.5,  \delta_{F_s} = 0.1)`
- :math:`S_0 \sim \text{LogNormalSigmaOverMu}( \mu_{S_0} = 100,  \delta_{S_0} = 0.1)`



The failure probability is:

.. math:: P_f = \Prob{G(m_p,m_s,k_p,k_z,\zeta_p,\zeta_s,F_s,Z_0) \leq 0}.


The value of :math:`P_f` is:

.. math:: P_f = 3.78 \times 10^{-7}.
