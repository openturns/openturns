.. OpenTURNS documentation master file, created by
   sphinx-quickstart on Wed Mar 12 14:11:36 2014.
   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

.. The toctree directive is mandatory on the root toctree file but we
   don't want it to be displayed in the body. So we use a no display
   CSS style.

.. raw:: html

    <div style="display: none;">
    

.. toctree::

    contents
    install
    user_manual/user_manual
    examples/examples
    theory
    contribute
    bibliography

.. raw:: html

    </div>

OpenTURNS is an open source initiative for the treatment of uncertainties,
risks'n statistics in a structured industrial approach.

    Complete the index page with fancy stuff or make it static as it is done
    on sphinx website. A static page might be more convenient for feeding the
    site with news.
