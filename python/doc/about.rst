About us
========

History
-------
Since the beginning of 2005, a partnership of three companies has been working
on building together a tool designed to perform uncertainty treatment and
reliability analysis.

- 2005: Conception, setup of the compilation infrastructure, setup of the development environment, first base classes.
- 2006: Development of the C++ library
- 2007: 6 releases (0.9.0-0.11.2) First release the 10th of May, website
- 2008: 4 releases (0.11.3-0.12.3) More distributions, more wrapping facilities
- 2009: 2 releases (0.13.0, 0.13.1) Multithreaded wrappers, new algorithms, polynomial chaos expansion
- 2010: 1 release (0.13.2) Windows port, modularization of the Python bindings, parallelization
- 2011: 2 releases (0.14.0, 0.15.0) TBB and CMake support, sparse chaos, Numpy compatibility
- 2012: 1 releases (1.0) Stochastic processes
- 2013: (1.1, 1.2) Bayesian updating, new matplotlib viewer
- 2014: (1.3, 1.4) Kriging, native windows support
- 2015: (1.5, 1.6) Vectorial kriging, HMat support
- 2016: (1.7, 1.8) Karhunen-Loeve process decomposition, NLopt bindings
- 2017: (1.9, 1.10) Canonical format low-rank tensor approximation, field functions
- 2018: (1.11, 1.12) Domains arithmetic, asymptotic Sobol' estimators, new simulation algorithms

exchange on their use of the library and keep up with the new features.
The 2019 edition is held at EDF Lab Saclay (France) on the 7th of June.
