History
-------
Since the beginning of 2005, a partnership of three companies has been working
on building together a tool designed to perform uncertainty treatment and
reliability analysis.

- 2005: Conception, setup of the compilation infrastructure, setup of the development environment, first base classes.
- 2006: Development of the C++ library
- 2007: 6 releases (0.9.0-0.11.2) First release the 10th of May, website
- 2008: 4 releases (0.11.3-0.12.3) More distributions, more wrapping facilities
- 2009: 2 releases (0.13.0, 0.13.1) Multithreaded wrappers, new algorithms, polynomial chaos expansion
- 2010: 1 release (0.13.2) Windows port, modularization of the Python bindings, parallelization
- 2011: 2 releases (0.14.0, 0.15.0) TBB and CMake support, sparse chaos, Numpy compatibility
- 2012: 1 releases (1.0) Stochastic processes
- 2013: (1.1, 1.2) Bayesian updating, new matplotlib viewer
- 2014: (1.3, 1.4) Kriging, native windows support
- 2015: (1.5, 1.6) Vectorial kriging, HMat support
- 2016: (1.7, 1.8) Karhunen-Loeve process decomposition, NLopt bindings
- 2017: (1.9, 1.10) Canonical format low-rank tensor approximation, field functions
- 2018: (1.11, 1.12) Domains arithmetic, asymptotic Sobol' estimators, new simulation algorithms
- 2019: (1.13, 1.14) Calibration, new optimization algorithms, system events
- 2020: (1.15, 1.16) hmat AcaRandom compression, Spectra iterative SVD, examples gallery, C++11, XML/H5 storage
