"""
Compute confidence intervals of a univariate noisy function
===========================================================
"""

# %%
#
# Introduction
# ------------
#
# In this example, we compute the pointwise confidence interval of the
# estimator of the conditional expectation given an input.
# We consider noisy observations of the sine function.
# Then we perform linear least squares regression to fit an order 4
# polynomial.
# For a given point x, the code computes the confidence interval
# of the prediction y.
# This is the confidence interval of the conditional expectation
# given the input.
# Secondly, we compute the confidence interval of the noisy output observations.
# In this advanced example, we use the :class:`~openturns.QRMethod` low level class.
# Another example of this method is presented in
# :doc:`/auto_numerical_methods/general_methods/plot_regression_interval`.

# %%
# In order to approximate the function with polynomials up to degree 4,

    Compute a confidence interval for the estimate of the mean.

    Evaluates this confidence interval at points in the design matrix.

    This code is based on (Rawlings, Pantula & David, 1998)

    Parameters
    ----------
    lsqMethod: ot.LeastSquaresMethod
        The linear least squares method (e.g. QR or Cholesky).
    betaHat : ot.Point(parameterDimension)
        The solution of the least squares problem.
    sigma2Hat : float > 0.0
        The estimate of the variance.
    designSample : ot.Sample(size, parameterDimension)
        The design matrix of the linear model.
        This is the value of the functional basis depending on the
        input sample.
        Each row represents the input where the confidence interval
        is to be computed.
    alpha : float, in [0, 1]
        The width of the confidence interval.
    mean : bool
        If True, then computes the confidence interval of the mean.
        This interval contains yTrue = E[y|x] with probability alpha.
        Otherwise, computes a confidence interval of the prediction at point x.
        This interval contains y|x with probability alpha.
    epsilonSigma : float > 0.0
        A relatively small number. The minimal value of variance, which
        avoids a singular Normal distribution.
