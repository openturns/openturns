# In this example we show how to create contour graphs and how to make the most of their display settings.

# %%
# The `draw` method, the `Graph` and `Contour` classes
# ----------------------------------------------------
#
# The simplest way to create a contour graph is to use the `draw` method of a bidimensional function.

# %%
import openturns as ot
import openturns.viewer as viewer

# %%
# We build a bidimensional function (function of x and y), define the study domain and the sample size

# %%
f = ot . SymbolicFunction(['x', 'y'], ['exp(-sin(cos(y)^2 * x^2 + sin(x)^2 * y^2))'])
XMin = -5.0
XMax = 5.0
YMin = -5.0
YMax = 5.0
NX = 75
NY = 75

# %%
# We build the graph by calling the `draw` method and display it

# %%
graph = f.draw([YMin, YMin], [XMax, YMax], [NX, NY])
view = viewer.View(graph)

# %%
# The graph contains an unique drawable whose implementation is of class `Contour`

# %%
contour = graph.getDrawable(0).getImplementation()
print(type(contour).__name__)

# %%
# Another way to build the contour is to build the data sample and give it to the constructor of the `Contour` class

# %%
inputData = ot.Box([NX, NY]).generate()
inputData *= [XMax - XMin, YMax - YMin]
inputData += [XMin, YMin]
data = f(inputData)

x = ot.Box([NX]).generate() * [XMax - XMin] + [XMin]
y = ot.Box([NY]).generate() * [YMax - YMin] + [YMin]
contour = ot.Contour(x, y, data)

# %%
# By creating an empty graph and adding the contour we can display the whole.

# %%
graph = ot.Graph('Complex iso lines', 'u1', 'u2', True)
graph.add(contour)
view = viewer.View(graph)

# %%
# The previous graph does not show the associated color bar.
# This point can be modified.
# We will also change the color map, the number of contour lines and hide the labels.

# %%
contour.setColorBarPosition('right')
contour.setColorMap('inferno')
contour.buildDefaultLevels(5)
contour.setDrawLabels(False)
graph.setDrawables([ot.Drawable(contour)])
view = viewer.View(graph)

# %%
# For such a function, contour lines are not easy to interpret.
# We will modify the contour to use filled areas.
contour.setIsFilled(True)
graph.setTitle('Complex filled contour')
graph.setDrawables([ot.Drawable(contour)])
view = viewer.View(graph)

# %%
# Sometimes the colors are not very distinct because some levels are very close while others are very far apart.
# In this case, it is possible to add hatching to the surfaces.
# Here we will also use transparency to soften the colors.

# %%
contour.setAlpha(0.3)
contour.setHatches(['/', '\\', '/\\', '+', '*'])
graph.setTitle('Complex filled contour with hatches')
graph.setDrawables([ot.Drawable(contour)])
view = viewer.View(graph)

# %%
# When the function takes values very different in magnitude, it may be useful to change the norm which is
# used to distribute the colors and to bound the color interval.
# Here we will also let `matplotlib` calculate the levels by not giving any level to the contour

# %%
contour.setColorMapNorm('log')
contour.setLevels([])
contour.setExtend('neither')
contour.setVmin(0.5)
contour.setVmax(2)
graph.setTitle('Complex contour with log norm and automatic levels')
graph.setDrawables([ot.Drawable(contour)])
view = viewer.View(graph)

# %%
# These capabilities can also be leveraged for distributions.
# We build here 2 distributions, Funky and Punk, which we mix.

# %%
corr = ot.CorrelationMatrix(2)
corr[0, 1] = 0.2
copula = ot.NormalCopula(corr)
x1 = ot.Normal(-1.0, 1)
x2 = ot.Normal(2, 1)
x_funk = ot.ComposedDistribution([x1, x2], copula)

x1 = ot.Normal(1.0, 1)
x2 = ot.Normal(-2, 1)
x_punk = ot.ComposedDistribution([x1, x2], copula)
mixture = ot.Mixture([x_funk, x_punk], [0.5, 1.0])

# %%
# The constructed graph is composed of the superposition of a filled contour and iso lines
# We also changed the thickness and style of the lines to show the effect although it is not useful here

# %%
graph = mixture.drawPDF([-5.0, -5.0], [5.0, 5.0])
# Add level lines above filled contour
contour = graph.getDrawable(0).getImplementation()
contour.setColor('black')
contour.setColorBarPosition("")
contour.setLineWidth(3)
contour.setLineStyle('dotdash')
graph.add(contour)
# Modify previous contour to fill the graph and use log norm
contour = graph.getDrawable(0).getImplementation()
contour.setIsFilled(True)
contour.setColorMapNorm('log')
graph.setDrawable(contour, 0)
view = viewer.View(graph)

# %%
# If the color bar is not sufficiently meaningful, it is possible to add the labels of the values of each level line on the drawing.
# Here the labels are reformatted to use scientific notation and define precision.
contour = graph.getDrawable(0).getImplementation()
contour.setColorBarPosition("")  # Hide color bar
graph.setDrawable(contour, 0)
contour = graph.getDrawable(1).getImplementation()
contour.setDrawLabels(True)
contour.setLabels(['{:.3g}'.format(level) for level in contour.getLevels()])
graph.setDrawable(contour, 1)
view = viewer.View(graph)

viewer.View.ShowAll()
