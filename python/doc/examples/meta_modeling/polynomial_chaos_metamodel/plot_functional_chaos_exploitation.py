Polynomial chaos exploitation
=============================
"""
# %%
# In this example we are going to create a global approximation of a model response using functional chaos and expose the associated results:
#
# - the composed model: :math:`h`: :math:`\underline{Z}^{\strut} \longrightarrow \underline{Y} = g \circ T^{-1}(\underline{Z})`,
#   which is the model of the reduced variables :math:`\underline{Z}`.
#   We have  :math:`\displaystyle h =  \sum_{k \in \mathbb N} \underline{\alpha}_k \Psi_k`,
# - the coefficients of the polynomial approximation : :math:`(\underline{\alpha}_k)_{k \in K}`,
# - the composed meta model: :math:`\hat{h}`, which is the model of the reduced variables reduced to the truncated multivariate basis :math:`(\Psi_k)_{k \in K}`.
#   We have :math:`\displaystyle  \hat{h} = \sum_{k \in K} \underline{\alpha}_k \Psi_k`,
# - the meta model: :math:`\displaystyle \hat{g} : \underline{X} \longrightarrow Y = \hat{h} \circ T(\underline{X})` which is the polynomial chaos approximation as a Function.
#   We have :math:`\displaystyle \hat{g} = \sum_{k \in K} \underline{\alpha}_k \Psi_k \circ T`,
# - the truncated multivariate basis : :math:`(\Psi_k)_{k \in K}`,
# - the indices :math:`K`,
# - the composition of each polynomial of the truncated multivariate basis :math:`\Psi_k`,
# - the distribution :math:`\mu` of the transformed variables :math:`\underline{Z}`.
