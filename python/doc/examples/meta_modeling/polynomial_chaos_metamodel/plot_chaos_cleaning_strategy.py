Create a sparse chaos by integration
====================================
"""
# %%
#
# The goal of this example is to show how to create a sparse polynomial chaos
# expansion (PCE) when we estimate its coefficients by integration. We show
# how to use the :class:`~openturns.CleaningStrategy` class.
#
# Polynomial chaos expansion
# --------------------------
#
# Let :math:`g : \mathcal{D} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}` be a function
# where :math:`\mathcal{D} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^p` is the domain of :math:`g`.
# We consider :math:`\vect{X}` a random vector which
# probability density function is denoted by :math:`f`.
# We assume that :math:`g(\vect{X})` has a finite second order moment.
# Let :math:`T` be an iso-probabilistic transformation such that :math:`\vect{Z} = T(\vect{X})`
# follows a distribution uniquely defined by all its moments.
# Let :math:`h` be the function defined by:
#
# .. math::
#
#   h = g \circ T^{-1}.
#
# The polynomial chaos decomposition of :math:`h` with respect to the measure of
# :math:`\vect{Z}` is (see [blatman2009]_ page 73) :
#
# .. math::
#
#   h(\vect{z}) = \sum_{\vect{\alpha} \in \mathbb{N}^p}
#   a_{\vect{\alpha}} \psi_{\vect{\alpha}}(\vect{z})
#
# where :math:`\vect{\alpha} = (\alpha_1, ..., \alpha_p) \in \mathbb{N}^p`
# is a multiindex, :math:`a_{\vect{\alpha}} \in \mathbb{R}` is the
# coefficient,  :math:`\psi_{\vect{\alpha}} : \mathcal{\bar{X}} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}`
# is a multivariate polynomial.

# %%
#
# Truncated expansion
# -------------------
# In practice, we cannot consider an infinite series and must truncate
# the decomposition at a given order. Only a selection of coefficients must
# be kept. This leads to a subset of all possible multiindices. In the
# remainder of this text, we call this selection the *multiindex set*.
#
# Several multiindex sets can be considered. A simple method is to truncate
# the polynomial up to a given maximum total degree :math:`d \in \mathbb{N}`.
# Let :math:`\mathcal{A}^{d}` be the multi-index set defined by
#
# .. math::
#
#   \mathcal{A}^{d} = \left\{ \vect{\alpha} \in \mathbb{N}^p
#   \; | \; \|\vect{\alpha}\|_1 \leq d\right\}
#
# where
#
# .. math::
#
#   \|\vect{\alpha}\|_d = \alpha_1 + ... + \alpha_p
#
# is the 1-norm of the multi-index :math:`\vect{\alpha}`.
# Therefore, the truncated polynomial chaos expansion is:
#
# .. math::
#
#   \widetilde{h}(\vect{z}) = \sum_{\vect{\alpha} \in \mathcal{A}^{d}}
#   a_{\vect{\alpha}} \psi_{\vect{\alpha}}(\vect{z}).
#
# In order to ensure a low error, we may choose a large value of the
# parameter :math:`P`. This, however, leads to a large number of
# coefficients :math:`\vect{\alpha} \in \mathcal{A}^{d}` to
# estimate. More precisely, the number of coefficients to estimate
# is (see [blatman2009]_ page 73) :
#
# .. math::
#
#   \textrm{card}\left(\mathcal{A}^{d}\right) = {p + d \choose d}
#   = \frac{(p + d)!}{p! d!}
#
# where :math:`p!` is the factorial number of :math:`p`.

# %%
#
# Low-rank polynomial chaos expansion
# -----------------------------------
# For any :math:`\vect{\alpha} \in \mathbb{N}^p`, let
# :math:`\|\vect{\alpha}\|_0` be the rank of the multiindex, that is,
# the number of nonzero components:
#
# .. math::
#
#   \|\vect{\alpha}\|_0 = \sum_{i = 1}^p \vect{1}_{\alpha_i > 0}
#
# where :math:`\vect{1}` is the indicator function.
# The multiindex set of maximum total degree :math:`d \in \mathbb{N}`
# and maximum rank :math:`j \in \mathbb{N}` is ([blatman2009]_ page 74):
#
# .. math::
#
#   \mathcal{A}^{d,j} = \left\{ \vect{\alpha} \in \mathbb{N}^p
#   \; | \; \|\vect{\alpha}\|_1 \leq d, \;
#   \; \|\vect{\alpha}\|_0 \leq j\right\}.
#
# Therefore, the rank-`j` polynomial chaos expansion is:
#
# .. math::
#
#   \widetilde{h}(\vect{z}) = \sum_{\vect{\alpha} \in
#   \mathcal{A}^{d,j}} a_{\vect{\alpha}}
#   \psi_{\vect{\alpha}}(\vect{z}).
#
# The rank is now a hyperparameter of the model: [blatman2009]_ suggests
# to use :math:`j = 2, 3, 4`. An example of low-rank PCE for the G-Sobol'
# function is given in [blatman2009]_ page 75.
#
# *Note.* It is currently not possible to create a low-rank PCE.

# %%
#
# Model selection
# ---------------
# If :math:`\textrm{card}\left(\mathcal{A}^{d}\right)` is large, many coefficients
# may be poorly estimated, which may reduce the quality of the metamodel. We may
# want to select a subset of the coefficients which best predict the output.
# In other words, we may compute a subset:
#
# .. math::
#
#   \mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathcal{A}^{d}
#
# such that ([blatman2009]_ page 86) :
#
# .. math::
#
#   \widetilde{h}(\vect{z}) = \sum_{\vect{\alpha} \in \mathcal{A}}
#   a_{\vect{\alpha}} \psi_{\vect{\alpha}}(\vect{z})
#
# An enumeration rule is a function from the set of integers :math:`k` to
# the corresponding set of multiindices :math:`\vect{\alpha}`. More
# precisely, let :math:`r : \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}^p` be the
# function such that :
#
# .. math::
#
#   r(k) = \vect{\alpha}
#
# for any :math:`k \geq 0`.
# Let :math:`K \in \mathbb{N}` be a parameter representing the number of
# coefficients considered in the selection. Given an enumeration rule for
# the multiindices :math:`\vect{\alpha}`, at most :math:`K` multiindices
# will be considered. Let :math:`\mathcal{A}_K` be the corresponding multiindex set :
#
# .. math::
#
#   \mathcal{A}_K = \left\{ \vect{\alpha}
#   \; | \; r^{-1}(\vect{\alpha}) = k \leq K \right\}.
#
#
# Let :math:`\epsilon > 0` be a parameter representing the minimum relative
# value of a significant coefficient :math:`a_{\vect{\alpha}}`.
# The :class:`~openturns.CleaningStrategy` uses the following criteria to select the coefficients :
#
# .. math::
#
#   \mathcal{A}_\epsilon =
#   \left\{
#   |a_{\vect{\alpha}}| \geq \epsilon \max_{ a_{\vect{\alpha}}
#   \in \mathcal{A}_K } |a_{\vect{\alpha}}| \right\}
#
# where :math:`\epsilon` is the significance factor, which by default is
# :math:`\epsilon = 10^{-4}`. This rule selects only the coefficients which
# are significantly different from zero.

# %%
#
# Sparsity index
# --------------
# The sparsity index of a multiindex set is the ratio of the cardinality of
# the multiindex set to the cardinality of the multiindex set of the
# equivalent multiindex with maximum total degree. For a given multiindex
# set :math:`\mathcal{A}`, let :math:`d` be the maximum 1-norm of multiindices
# in the set :
#
# .. math::
#
#   d := \textrm{max}_{\vect{\alpha} \in \mathcal{A}}
#   \|\vect{\alpha}\|_1.
#
# The index of sparsity of :math:`\mathcal{A}` is ([blatman2009]_  eq. 4.42 page 86) :
#
# .. math::
#
#   \textrm{IS}(\mathcal{A})
#   = \frac{\textrm{card}(\mathcal{A})}{\textrm{card}\left(\mathcal{A}^d\right)}.
#
#
# *Note.* The index of sparsity as defined by [blatman2009]_ is close to zero when
# the model is very sparse. The following complementary indicator is close
# to 1 when the model is very sparse:
#
# .. math::
#
#   \textrm{IS}_{\textrm{c}}(\mathcal{A})
#   = 1 - \frac{\textrm{card}(\mathcal{A})}{\textrm{card}\left(\mathcal{A}^d\right)}.

# - `Psi_k_p_` : the collection of functions in the current active polynomial multiindex set,

# - `addedPsi_k_ranks_` : the list of indices to add the multiindex set,
# - `removedPsi_k_ranks_` : the list of indices to remove to the multiindex set,

# Each time the selection method is called, it is passed a
# coefficient :math:`a_{\vect{\alpha}}` which is a new candidate to be

# The previous text (and a detailed analysis of the output file) allows one to
# understand what exactly happens in the algorithm. To understand each step,
# note that the significant threshold is equal to :math:`\epsilon = 10^{-10}`.
#
# - During the initialization, the initial basis is empty and filled with the
#   indices [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15].
#   The coefficient with index equal to 0 corrresponds to the mean of the
#   polynomial chaos expansion. As a result, we always want to select that
#   coefficient in the active set.
#   Hence, the calculation of the largest coefficient in absolute value is
#   performed from the indices from 1 to 15.
#   The largest coefficient in absolute value is :math:`a_1 = 1.625`, which leads
#   to the threshold :math:`\epsilon |a_1| = 1.625 \times 10^{-10}`. Most of
#   the considered coefficient are, however, too close to zero. This is why only
#   the coefficients [0, 1, 7, 10, 15] are kept in the basis. The
#   corresponding coefficients are [3.505, 1.625,-0.6414, -1.291, 1.372].
# - On step 1, the candidate index 16 is considered. Its coefficient is
#   :math:`a_{16} = -1.197 \times 10^{-15}`, which is much too low to be
#   selected. Hence, the basis is unchanged and the active multiindex set
#   is [0, 1, 7, 10, 15] on the end of this step.
# - From the step 3 to the step 15, the active multiindex set is unchanged,
#   because no considered coefficient becomes greater than the threshold.
# - On step 16, the candidate index 30 is considered, with corresponding
#   coefficient :math:`a_{30} = -1.612`. Since this coefficient has an absolute
#   value greater than the threshold, it gets selected and the active multiindex
#   set is [0, 1, 7, 10, 15, 30] on the end of this step. From this step to the
#   end, the index 30 will not leave the active set.
# - On the step 20, the index 35 enters the active set.
# - On the step 25, the index 40 enters the active set.
# - On the step 34, the index 49 enters the active set.
# - On the step 69, the index 84 enters the active set.
# - On the step 74, the index 89 enters the active set.
# - On the step 83, the index 98 enters the active set.
# - On the last step, the active multiindex set contains the indices
#   [0, 1, 7, 10, 15, 30, 35, 40, 49, 84, 89, 98] and the corresponding
#   coefficients are [3.508, 1.625, -0.6414, -1.291, 1.372, -1.613, 0.2076,
#   -1.090, 0.4092, -0.2078, 0.1753, -0.3250].
#
# We see that the algorithm was able so select 12 coefficients in the first
# 101 coefficients considered by the algorithm. It could have selected
# more coefficients since we provided 16 slots to fill thanks to the
# `mostSignificant` parameter. The considered coefficients were, however,
# too close to zero and were below the threshold.

#
# Conclusion
# ----------
#
# We see that the :class:`~openturns.CleaningStrategy` class performs correctly in
# this particular case. We have seen how to select the hyperparameters which
# produce the best R2 score.
