"""
Estimate a multivariate ARMA process
====================================
"""
# %%
# The objective of the Use Case is to estimate a multivariate ARMA model
# from a stationary time series using the maximum likelihood estimator
# and a centered normal white noise.
# The data can be a unique time series or several time series collected
# in a process sample.
#
# We estimate :math:`(\underline{\beta}, \sigma^2)` thanks to the
# *ARMALikelihoodFactory* object and its method *build*, acting on a
# time series or on a sample of time series. It produces a result of
# type *ARMA*.
# Note that no evaluation of selection criteria such as *AIC* and *BIC*
# is done.
#
# The synthetic data is generated from the 2-d ARMA model:
#
# .. math::
#    \begin{aligned}
#    X_{0,t} - 0.5 X_{0,t-1} - 0.1 X_{1,t-1} = E_{0,t} - 0.4 E_{0,t-1} \\
#    X_{1,t} - 0.4 X_{0,t-1} - 0.5 X_{1,t-1} - 0.25 X_{0,t-2} = E_{1,t} - 0.4 E_{1,t-1}
#    \end{aligned}
#
# with E the white noise:
#   
# .. math:: 
#     E \sim \mathcal{N} ([0,0], [0.1,0.2])
