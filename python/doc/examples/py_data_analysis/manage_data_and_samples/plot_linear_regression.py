Build and validate a linear model
=================================
"""
# %%
# In this example we are going to build a linear regression model and validate it numerically and graphically.
#
# The linear model between links a scalar variable :math:`Y` and to an n-dimensional one :math:`\underline{X} = (X_i)_{i \leq n}`, as follows:
#
# .. math::
#    \tilde{Y} = a_0 + \sum_{i=1}^n a_i X_i + \varepsilon
#   
# where :math:`\varepsilon` is the residual, supposed to follow the Normal(0.0, 1.0) distribution.
#
# The linear model may be validated graphically if :math:`\underline{X}` is of dimension 1, by drawing on the same graph the cloud :math:`(X_i, Y_i)`.
#
# The linear model also be validate numerically with several tests:
#
# - LinearModelFisher: tests the nullity of the regression linear model coefficients (Fisher distribution used),
# - LinearModelResidualMean: tests, under the hypothesis of a gaussian sample, if the mean of the residual is equal to zero. It is based on the Student test (equality of mean for two gaussian samples).
#
#
# The hypothesis on the residuals (centered gaussian distribution) may be validated:
#
# - graphically if :math:`\underline{X}` is of dimension 1, by drawing the residual couples (:math:`\varepsilon_i, \varepsilon_{i+1}`), where the residual :math:`\varepsilon_i` is evaluated on the samples :math:`(X, Y)`.
# - numerically with the LinearModelResidualMean Test which tests, under the hypothesis of a gaussian sample, if the mean of the residual is equal to zero. It is based on the Student test (equality of mean for two gaussian samples).
