Define a connection function with a field output
================================================
"""

# %%
# In this example, we define a function which has a vector input and a field output.
# The goal of this example is to show how to use :class:`~openturns.PointToFieldConnection` class to combine two functions.
# A detailed explanation of the model is presented :ref:`here <use-case-viscous-fall>`.

# %%
# Define the model
# ----------------

# %%
import openturns as ot
import openturns.viewer as otv
from openturns.usecases import viscous_free_fall

ot.Log.Show(ot.Log.NONE)

# %%
# Load the viscous free fall example.
vff = viscous_free_fall.ViscousFreeFall()
distribution = vff.distribution
model = vff.model

# %%
# Restrict the number of inputs
# -----------------------------

# %%
# We define a function which has input only `z0` as input to *freeze* the 3 other inputs of the original model:
fz0 = ot.SymbolicFunction(["z0"], ["z0", "55", "80", "15"])

# %%
# Then we use the :class:`~openturns.PointToFieldConnection` to compose it with the original model.
model_z0 = ot.PointToFieldConnection(model, fz0)

# %%
# Sample trajectories
# --------------------

# %%
# In order to sample trajectories, we use the `getSample` method of the distribution of `z0` and apply the field function.
size = 10
inputSample = vff.distZ0.getSample(size)
outputSample = model_z0(inputSample)

# %%
# Draw viscous free fall trajectories.
graph = outputSample.drawMarginal(0)
graph.setTitle("Viscous free fall: %d trajectories" % (size))
graph.setXTitle(r"$t$")
graph.setYTitle(r"$z$")
view = otv.View(graph)
otv.View.ShowAll()
