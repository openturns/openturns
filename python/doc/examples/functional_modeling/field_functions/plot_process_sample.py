# In this example, a :class:`~openturns.ProcessSample` is created from data.
# The purpose is to illustrate how to create a :class:`~openturns.ProcessSample` from an already available sample of a field.
# In addition, the computation of statistics of the process sample is presented.
# The :class:`~openturns.ProcessSample` is defined over a :class:`~openturns.Mesh`.
#
# For this example, the realizations of a stochastic process are obtained using the Chaboche model.
# A detailed explanation of this mechanical law is presented :ref:`here <use-case-chaboche>`.
# In this example, the model is defined such that:
# :math:`\sigma=g(\vect{X},\epsilon)`
# with :math:`\vect{X}=[R,C,\gamma]^T` a vector of random variables and
#
# - the strain :math:`\epsilon\in[0.,0.07]`
# - the stress :math:`\sigma`

# %%
# Define the model and the mesh
# -----------------------------

# %%
# First, the Chaboche model is loaded.

# %%
cm = chaboche_model.ChabocheModel()

# %%
# Then, a mesh using a :class:`~openturns.RegularGrid` is defined for the strain :math:`\epsilon\in[0.,0.07]` with :math:`N=100` vertices.

# %%
N = 100
mesh = ot.RegularGrid(cm.strainMin, (cm.strainMax - cm.strainMin) / N, N)

# %%
# Generate one sample of the field
# --------------------------------

# %%
# One sample of the field is obtained by evaluating the Chaboche model on the mesh vertices
# for one specific realization of the input vector :math:`\vect{X}_0=[700\times 10^6,2500\times 10^6,8.]^T`.

# The distribution of the input vector :math:`\vect{X}` is defined here:

# Generate different samples of the field
# ---------------------------------------

# %%
# 50 samples of the input vector :math:`\vect{X}` are generated.

# Creation of the process sample
# ------------------------------

# %%
# It is possible to create a :class:`~openturns.ProcessSample` from the obtained field samples.
# For that, each obtained sample is added to the :class:`~openturns.ProcessSample` using the :class:`~openturns.Field` structure.
# When the :class:`~openturns.ProcessSample` is created, by default a process sample with a value of 0.
# for all the vertices is stored so it is important to remove it.

# It is then possible to compute different statistics on the :class:`~openturns.ProcessSample` such as the mean, median, variance, ...

# %%
