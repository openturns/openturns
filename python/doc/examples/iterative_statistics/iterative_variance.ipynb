    "In this example, we show how to use the `IterativeMean` and `IterativeVariance` classes. These algorithms compute an estimate of the mean and variance using iterative algorithms. In other words, these algorithm can be used to iteratively update the estimate of the mean or variance using one point at a time instead of using the full sample. "
