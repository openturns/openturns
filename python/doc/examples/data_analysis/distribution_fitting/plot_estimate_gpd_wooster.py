Estimate a GPD on the Wooster temperature data

# %%
# In this example, we illustrate various techniques of extreme value modeling applied
# to the 5-year series of daily minimum temperatures recorded in Wooster, Ohio between 1983 and 1988.
# Readers should refer to [coles2001]_ example 1.7 to get more details.

# First, we load the Wooster dataset. As we want to model very low temperatures,
# we first negate the values to transform minimum to maximum. Hence, large positive
# observations correspond to extreme cold conditions. We look at the negated data
# through time. The data are plotted as degrees Fahrenheit below zero. We see that
# there is a strong annual cycle in the data.
#
# We use the pandas library.

# Here, we illustrate that threshold exceedances occur in groups: one
# extremely cold day is likely to be followed by another, implying that observations
# exceeding a high threshold are dependent. Hence we use the declustering method
# which filters the dependent observations exceeding a given threshold to obtain a
# set of threshold excesses that can be assumed as independent.
#
# First, we specify a threshold :math:`u`.
# Consecutive exceedances of the threshold belong to the same cluster. Two distinct
# clusters are separated by :math:`r` consecutive observations under the
# threshold. Within each cluster, we select the maximum value that will be used to
# infer the GPD distribution. The cluster maxima are assumed to be independent.
#
# On the graph, we show the clusters associated to the threshold :math:`u=0`
# and the respective maximum selected from a
# 100-day portion of the Wooster daily minimum temperature series.
# It is possible to extract the data belonging to the same cluster and the
# cluster maximum series.

# %%
# Here, we illustrate the effect of different choices for :math:`u`
# and :math:`r` on the estimate of the GPD distriution. We focus on the winter
# season. We perform the following steps, for each :math:`(u, r)`:
#
# - we extract the clusters and the associated peaks,
# - we fit a GPD distribution on the excesses by the maximum likelihood method,
# - we estimate the :math:`95\%` confidence interval of each parameter,
# - we evaluate the :math:`T=100`-year return level which corresponds to the
#   :math:`m`-observation return level, where :math:`m = T*n_y` with :math:`n_y`
#   the number of observations per year. Here, we consider the winter season
#   which is about 90 days long. To calculate it, we evaluate the extremal index
#   :math:`\theta` which is the inverse of the mean length of the clusters,
#   estimated by the ratio between the number of clusters and the number
#   of exceedances of :math:`u`.
#
# The stability in the return level estimations confirms that the
# inference is robust despite the subjective choices that need to be made
# on :math:`(u, r)`.
