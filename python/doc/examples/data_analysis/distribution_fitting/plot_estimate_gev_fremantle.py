Estimate a GEV on the Fremantle sea-levels data
===============================================
"""
# %%
# In this example, we illustrate various techniques of extreme value modeling applied
# to the annual maximum sea-levels recorded at Fremantle, near Perth, western Australia, over the period
# 1897-1989.
# Readers should refer to [coles2001]_ to get more details.
#
# We illustrate techniques to:
#
# - estimate a stationary and a non stationary GEV depending on time or on the covariates (time, SOI),
# - estimate a return level,
#
# using:
#
# - the log-likelihood function,
# - the profile log-likelihood function.
#
# We also illustrate the modelling with covariates.
#
# First, we load the Fremantle dataset of the annual maximum sea-levels. We start by looking at them
# through time. The data also contain the annual mean value of the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI),
# which is a proxy for meteorological volatility due to effects such as El Nino.

# If we look at the data carefully, we see that the pattern of variation has not remained constant over

# a significant impact on the safety of coastal flood defenses.
#
# We have define the functional basis for each parameter of the GEV model. Even if we have

# it is strongly recommended not to vary the parameter :math:`\xi` and to let it constant.
#
# For numerical reasons, it is strongly recommended to normalize all the data as follows:
#
# .. math::
#
#     \tau(t) = \dfrac{t-c}{d}
#
# where:
#
# - the *CenterReduce* method where :math:`c = \dfrac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n t_i` is the mean time stamps
#   and :math:`d = \sqrt{\dfrac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (t_i-c)^2}` is the standard deviation of the time stamps;
# - the *MinMax* method where :math:`c = t_1` is the initial time and :math:`d = t_n-t_1` the final time;
# - the *None* method where :math:`c = 0` and :math:`d = 1`: in that case, data are not normalized.
#
# We suppose that :math:`\mu` is linear in time, and that the other parameters remain constant:
#
# .. math::
#     :nowrap:
#
#     \begin{align*}
#       \mu(t) & = \beta_1 + \beta_2\tau(t) \\

# We can now estimate the list of coefficients :math:`\vect{\beta} = (\beta_1, \beta_2, \beta_3, \beta_4)`

# We can see that:
#
# - both normalization methods lead to the same result for :math:`\beta_1`, :math:`\beta_3` and :math:`\beta_4`
#   (note that :math:`\beta_2` depends on the normalization function),
# - both initial points lead to the same result when the data have been normalized,
# - it is very important to normalize all the data: if not, the result strongly depends on the initial point
#   and it differs from the result obtained with normalized data. The results are not optimal in that case
#   since the associated log-likelihood are much smaller than those obtained with normalized data.
