Estimate a GEV on race times data
=================================
"""
# %%
# In this example, we illustrate various techniques of extreme value modeling applied
# to the fatest annual race times for the women's 1500 meter event over the period 1975-1992.
# Readers should refer to [coles2001]_ to get more details.
#
# We illustrate techniques to:
#
# - estimate a stationary and a non stationary GEV,
# - estimate a return level,
#
# using:
#
# - the log-likelihood function,
# - the profile log-likelihood function.
#
# This analyse is particular as we are interested in modeling the annual minimum race times and not
# the annual maximum race times. In order to transform the minimum modeling into a maximum modeling,
# we proceeds as follows.
#
# We denote by :math:`\tilde{M}_n = \min (X_1, \dots, X_n)` where all the :math:`X_i` are
# independent and identically distributed variables. We introduce
# :math:`Y_i = -X_i` for :math:`1 \leq i \leq n`,
# and :math:`M_n = \min (Y_1, \dots, Y_n)`. Then, we have:
#
# .. math::
#    \tilde{M}_n = - M_n.
#
# We can show that if the renormalized maximum :math:`\tilde{M}_n` tends to the GEV distribution
# parametrized by :math:`(\mu, \sigma, \xi)`, then the renormalized minimum :math:`\tilde{M}_n` tends to
# the *GEV for minima* distribution parametrized by :math:`(\tilde{\mu}, \tilde{\sigma}, \tilde{\xi})` where:
#
# .. math::
#     :nowrap:
#
#     \begin{align*}
#       \tilde{\mu} & = -\mu \\
#       \tilde{\sigma} & = \sigma\\
#       \tilde{\xi} & = \xi
#     \end{align*}
#
# The cumulated distribution function of :math:`\tilde{M}_n`, denoted by :math:`\tilde{G}`, is defined by:
#
# .. math::
#    \tilde{G}(z) = 1-G(-z) = 1-\exp \left( -\left[ 1-\tilde{\xi} \left( \dfrac{z-\tilde{\mu}}{\tilde{\sigma}}\right)\right]^{-1/\tilde{\xi}}\right)
#
# for all :math:`z` such that :math:`1-\tilde{\xi}(z-\tilde{\mu})/\tilde{\sigma} > 0`.
#
# In that example, we model the :math:`M_n` variable which is the annual maximum of the opposite race times.
#
# First, we load the race times dataset. We start by looking at them through time.

# the possibility to affect a time-varying model to each of the 3 parameters :math:`(\mu, \sigma, \xi)`,
# it is strongly recommended not to vary the parameter :math:`\xi` and to let it constant.
#
# For numerical reasons, it is strongly recommended to normalize all the data as follows:
#
# .. math::
#
#     \tau(t) = \dfrac{t-c}{d}
#
# where:
#
# - the *CenterReduce* method where :math:`c = \dfrac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n t_i` is the mean time stamps
#   and :math:`d = \sqrt{\dfrac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (t_i-c)^2}` is the standard deviation of the time stamps;
# - the *MinMax* method where :math:`c = t_1` is the initial time and :math:`d = t_n-t_1` the final time;
# - the *None* method where :math:`c = 0` and :math:`d = 1`: in that case, data are not normalized.
#
# We suppose that :math:`\mu` is linear in time, and that the other parameters remain constant.
#
# .. math::
#     :nowrap:
#
#     \begin{align*}
#       \mu(t) & = \beta_1 + \beta_2\tau(t) \\
#       \sigma(t) & = \beta_3 \\

# We can now estimate the list of coefficients :math:`\vect{\beta} = (\beta_1, \beta_2, \beta_3, \beta_4)` using the log-likelihood of the data.

#   (note that :math:`\beta_2` depends on the normalization function),
# - both initial points lead to the same result when the data have been normalized,
# - it is very important to normalize all the data: if not, the result strongly depends on the initial point
#   and it differs from the result obtained with normalized data. The results are not optimal in that case
#   since the associated log-likelihood are much smaller than those obtained with normalized data.
