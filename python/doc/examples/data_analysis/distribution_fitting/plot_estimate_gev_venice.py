"""
Estimate a GEV on the Venice sea-levels data
============================================
"""
# %%
# In this example, we illustrate various techniques of extreme value modeling applied
# to the annual maximum sea-levels recorded in Venice over the period 1931-1981.
# Readers should refer to [coles2001]_ to get more details.
#
# We illustrate techniques to:
#
# - estimate a stationary GEV, using the :math:`r`-largest annual sea-levels for :math:`r\geq 1`,
#
# using:
#
# - the log-likelihood function,
# - the profile log-likelihood function.
#
# First, we load the 10 largest annual sea-levels in Venice. We start by looking at them
# through time. Note that for the year 1935, only the largest 6 observations are available.
# For simplicity of the example, we removed that year from the data but it could be
# used for all the analyses beased on the largest :math:`r` annual sea-levels for :math:`r \leq 6`.
