"""
Visualize pairs between two samples
===================================
"""

# %%
# In this example we visualize the relationships between the marginal samples of two given samples.
# This is usual when we analyze the relationship of output sample of a model depending on input sample.
# This can be achieved by plotting the outputs versus the inputs.
# When there are several inputs (which is the most often encountered case) and several outputs (which is less often).
# The :meth:`~openturns.VisualTest.DrawPairsXY` method provides a tool to plot the pairs of input and output marginal samples and see the correlations graphically.

# Create the model

)

# Create the input data to visualize
