"""
Calibrate a parametric model: a quick-start guide to calibration
================================================================

In this example we present the calibration of a parametric module.
To do this, we show how to define the observations.
Then we create a Python function and create the parametric model that is
to be calibrated.
Finally, we calibrate the parameters of the model using least squares
and we validate the hypotheses of the method.

Please read :ref:`code_calibration` for more details on code calibration and least squares.
In this example we are interested in the calibration of the :ref:`flooding model <use-case-flood-model>`.
Once the reader has mastered this example, the :doc:`calibration of the Chaboche mechanical model
</auto_calibration/least_squares_and_gaussian_calibration/plot_calibration_chaboche>` may be
considered to make an in-depth study of these algorithms.
The goal of this script is to be relatively small, so please consider reading
the other examples if this is relevant.

# %%
# Parameters to calibrate and observations
# ----------------------------------------
#
# The parametric model is:
#
# .. math::
#    H = a Q^b.
#
# The vector of parameters to calibrate is:
#
# .. math::
#    \theta = (a,b).
#
# We consider a sample size equal to:
#
# .. math::
#    n = 10.
#
# The observations are the couples :math:`\{(Q_i,H_i)\}_{i=1,...,n}`, i.e. each observation is a
# couple made of the flowrate and the corresponding river height.
#
# We choose to calibrate this model using non linear least squares, because
# this is a relatively flexible method.

# Define the observations
# -----------------------
# In practice, we generally use a data set which has been obtained from
# measurements.
# This data set can be loaded using e.g. :meth:`~openturns.Sample.ImportFromCSVFile`.
# Here we import the data from the
# :class:`~openturns.usecases.flood_model.FloodModel`

# %%
# Create the physical model
# -------------------------
# We define the model :math:`g` which has 3 inputs and one output `H`.
# This model has a parametric shape that may correspond to the data,
# which has some power shape.
# In the model, the parameters are `a` and `b`, the input is `Q`
# and the output is `H`:
# - `Q` : the flowrate of the river,
# - `a`, `b` : the parameters.

# and 2 in the physical model.

# Calibration with non linear least squares
# -----------------------------------------

# non linear least squares calibration by minimizing the squared Euclidian norm

# %%
# Analysis of the results
# -----------------------

# %%
# The :meth:`~openturns.CalibrationResult.getParameterMAP` method returns the
# maximum of the posterior distribution of :math:`\theta`.

# One of the hypotheses of the least squares method is that
# the residuals follow a normal distribution: the next
# cell checks if this hypothesis is satisfied here.

# %%
graph = calibrationResult.drawResiduals()
graph.setLegendPosition("upper left")
view = otv.View(graph)

# %%
# The analysis of the residuals shows that the distribution is centered on
# zero and symmetric.
# This indicates that the calibration performed well.
# Moreover, the distribution of the residuals is close to being Gaussian.

# %%
# *Remark.* The logarithm of the height is:
#
# .. math::
#    \log(H) = \log(a) + b \log(Q).
#
# Hence, transforming the data on a logarithmic scale leads to a parametric
# model that is linear in the parameters.
# The parameters of this transformed model can be estimated using linear
# linear squares, which may lead to a significant improvement in terms
# of number of function evaluations.
