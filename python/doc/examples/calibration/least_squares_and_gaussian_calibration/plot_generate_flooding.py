"""
Generate flooding model observations
====================================

In this example we are interested in the calibration of the :ref:`flooding model <use-case-flood-model>`.
We show how to produce the observations that we use in the calibration
model of :doc:`Calibration of the flooding model
</auto_calibration/least_squares_and_gaussian_calibration/plot_calibration_flooding>`.

In practice, we generally use a data set which has been obtained from
measurements.
In this example, we generate the data using noisy observations of the
physical model.
In the next part, we will calibrate the parameters using the calibration
algorithms.

# Parameters to calibrate
# -----------------------
#
# The variables to calibrate are :math:`(K_s,Z_v,Z_m)` and are set to the following values:
#
# .. math::
#    K_s = 30, \qquad Z_v = 50, \qquad Z_m = 55.
#
# This is the set of *true* values that we wish to estimate with the calibration methods.
# In practical studies, these values are unknown.
# In this study, we will simulate noisy observations of the output of the model
# and estimate the parameters using calibration methods.
#
# Observations
# ------------
#
# In this section, we describe the statistical model associated with the :math:`n` observations.
# The errors of the water heights are associated with a normal distribution
# with a zero mean and a standard variation equal to:
#
# .. math::
#    \sigma=0.1.
#
#
# Therefore, the observed water heights are:
#
# .. math::
#    H_i = G(Q_i,K_s,Z_v,Z_m) + \epsilon_i
#
#
# for :math:`i=1,...,n` where
#
# .. math::
#    \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2)
#
#
# and we make the hypothesis that the observation errors are independent.
# We consider a sample size equal to:
#
# .. math::
#    n = 10.
#
#
# The observations are the couples :math:`\{(Q_i,H_i)\}_{i=1,...,n}`, i.e. each observation is a
# couple made of the flowrate and the corresponding river height.
