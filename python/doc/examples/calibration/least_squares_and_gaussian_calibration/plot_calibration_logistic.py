Calibration of the logistic model
=================================

We present a calibration study of the logistic growth model defined :ref:`here <use-case-logistic>`.
The data set that we use is the U.S. population from 1790 to 2000.
One of the specific properties of this study is that the observations
that we use are real world observations.
Hence when we calibrate the model on the data, there is a discrepancy that will
be seen.
In this example, we calibrate the parameters of a model which predicts
the dynamics of the size of a population.
This shows how we can calibrate a model which predicts a time
dependent output.
The output of the model is a time series representing the evolution of the
population.
This requires a transpose of the sample, so that we can benefit from
the visualization methods.

Variables
---------

In the particular situation where we want to calibrate this model, the
following list presents which variables are observed input variables,
input calibrated variables and observed output variables.

- :math:`t`: Input. Observed.
- :math:`z_0`, :math:`a`, :math:`c`: Inputs. Calibrated.
- :math:`z`: Output. Observed.
