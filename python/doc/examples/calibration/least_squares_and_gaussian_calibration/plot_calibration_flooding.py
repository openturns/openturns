Calibration of the flooding model
=================================

In this example we are interested in the calibration of the :ref:`flooding model <use-case-flood-model>`.
We calibrate the parameters of a flooding model where only the difference between the
downstream and upstream riverbed levels can be calibrated.
This example shows how to manage the lack of identifiability in a calibration problem.

This example use least squares to calibrate the parametric
model.
Please read :ref:`code_calibration` for more details on code calibration and least squares.
This study is relatively complicated: please read the :doc:`calibration of the Chaboche mechanical model
</auto_calibration/least_squares_and_gaussian_calibration/plot_calibration_chaboche>` first if this is not already done.
The observations that we use in this study are simulated with the script
:doc:`Generate flooding model observations
</auto_calibration/least_squares_and_gaussian_calibration/plot_generate_flooding>`.

# Parameters to calibrate and observations
# ----------------------------------------
#
# The variables of the model are:
#
# - :math:`Q` : Input. Observed.
# - :math:`K_s`, :math:`Z_v`, :math:`Z_m` : Input. Calibrated.
# - :math:`H`: Output. Observed.
#
# The vector of parameters to calibrate is:
#
# .. math::
#    \theta = (K_s,Z_v,Z_m).
#
# In the description of the :ref:`flooding model<use-case-flood-model>`,
# we see that only one parameter can be identified.
# Hence, calibrating this model requires some regularization.
# We return to this topic when analyzing the singular values of
# the Jacobian matrix.
#
# We consider a sample size equal to:
#
# .. math::
#    n = 10.
#
#
# The observations are the couples :math:`\{(Q_i,H_i)\}_{i=1,...,n}`, i.e. each observation is a
# couple made of the flowrate and the corresponding river height.

# Create the physical model
# -------------------------
# We define the model :math:`g` which has 4 inputs and one output H.
#
# The nonlinear least squares algorithm does not take into account for bounds
# in the parameters.
# Therefore, we ensure that the output is computed whatever the inputs.
# The model fails into two situations:
#
# * if :math:`K_s<0`,
# * if :math:`Z_v-Z_m<0`.
#
# In these cases, we return an infinite number, so that the optimization
# algorithm does not get trapped.

# The rank of the problem can be seen from the singular values of the Jacobian
# matrix.

# %%
print(jacobianMatrix.computeSingularValues())

# %%
# We can see that there are two singular values which are relatively close to zero.
#
# This explains why the Jacobian matrix is close to being rank-degenerate.
#
# Moreover, this allows one to compute the actual dimensionality of the problem.
# The algorithm we use computes the singular values in descending order.
# Moreover, by definition, the singular values are nonnegative.
# We see that the first singular value is close to :math:`10`
# and the others are very close to :math:`0` in comparison.
# This implies that the (numerical) rank of the Jacobian matrix is 1,
# even if there are 3 parameters.
#
# Hence, only one parameter can be identified, be it :math:`K_s`, :math:`Z_v`
# or :math:`Z_m`.
# The choice of the particular parameter to identify is free.
# However, in hydraulic studies, the parameter :math:`K_s` is classically
# calibrated while :math:`Z_v` and :math:`Z_m` are left constant.

# %%
# Conclusion of the linear least squares calibration
# --------------------------------------------------

# %%
# There are several methods to solve the problem.
#
# * Given that the problem is not identifiable, we can use some regularization
#   method. Two methods are provided in the library: the Gaussian linear least
#   squares `GaussianLinearCalibration` and the Gaussian non linear least
#   squares `GaussianNonlinearCalibration`.
# * We can change the problem, replacing it with a problem which is identifiable.
#   In the flooding model, we can view :math:`Z_v` and :math:`Z_m` as
#   constants and calibrate :math:`K_s` only.
#
# In this example, we do not change the problem and see how the different
# methods perform.

# %%
# Calibration with non linear least squares
# -----------------------------------------
# The :class:`~openturns.NonLinearLeastSquaresCalibration` class performs the
# non linear least squares calibration by minimizing the squared Euclidian norm
# between the predictions and the observations.

# %%

# "NonLinearLeastSquaresCalibration-BootstrapSize" is unchanged).
