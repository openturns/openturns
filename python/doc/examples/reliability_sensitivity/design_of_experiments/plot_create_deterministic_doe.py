# Four types of deterministic designs of experiments are available:
#
# - :class:`~openturns.Axial`
# - :class:`~openturns.Factorial`
# - :class:`~openturns.Composite`
# - :class:`~openturns.Box`
#
# Each type of deterministic design is discretized differently according to a number of levels.
#
# Functionally speaking, a design is a :class:`~openturns.Sample` that lies within the unit cube :math:`(0,1)^d` and can be scaled and moved to cover the desired box.


# %%
# We will use the following function to plot bi-dimensional samples.

# %%

    n = sample.getSize()
    graph = ot.Graph("%s, size=%d" % (title, n), r"$X_1$", r"$X_2$", True, '')

# Axial design

levels = [1.0, 1.5, 3.0]

# Use \*= to rescale and += to move a design.
# Pay attention to the grid in the next graph.

# %%
sample *= 2.0
sample += [5.0, 8.0]
graph = drawBidimensionalSample(sample, "Axial")
view = viewer.View(graph)

# %%
# Factorial design
# ----------------
#

# %%
experiment = ot.Factorial(2, levels)
sample = experiment.generate()
sample *= 2.0
sample += [5.0, 8.0]
graph = drawBidimensionalSample(sample, "Factorial")
view = viewer.View(graph)

# %%
# Composite design
# ----------------
#
# A composite design is a stratified design of experiments enabling to create a pattern as the union of an Axial pattern and a Factorial one. The number of points generated is :math:`1 + n_{\mathrm{level}}(2n+2^n)`.
#

# %%

sample = experiment.generate()
sample *= 2.0
sample += [5.0, 8.0]

# %%
# Grid design
# -----------
#

# %%
levels = [3, 4]
experiment = ot.Box(levels)
sample = experiment.generate()
sample *= 2.0
sample += [5.0, 8.0]
