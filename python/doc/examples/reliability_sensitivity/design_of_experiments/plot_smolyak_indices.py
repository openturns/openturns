Plot Smolyak multi-indices
==========================
"""
# %%
# The goal of this example is to plot the multi-indices used in Smolyak's
# quadrature.
#
# For a given dimension :math:`d_x \in \mathbb{N}` and a given level
# :math:`\ell \in \mathbb{N}`
# Smolyak's quadrature is the combination of tensorized univariate quadratures.
# These quadrature are defined by the set of multi-indices:
#
# .. math::
#
#     \mathcal{S}_{\ell, d_x} = \left\{\|\boldsymbol{k}\|_1 \leq \ell
#                                      + d_x - 1\right\}
#
# where :math:`\|\boldsymbol{k}\|_1 = k_1 + ... + k_{d_x}` is the 1-norm of the
# multi-index :math:`\boldsymbol{k} \in \mathbb{N}^{d_x}`.
#
# The goal of this script is to plot the multi-indices involved in Smolyak's
# quadrature for different values of the level :math:`\ell` in
# dimension :math:`d_x = 2`.

# In the first example, we print the indices involved in
# Smolyak-Legendre quadrature of level 3.
# The multi-indices are computed using the
# :py:meth:`openturns.experimental.SmolyakExperiment.computeCombination` method.
# Actually, the multi-indices do not actually depend on the
# underlying univariate quadratures, but this is required for
# the :class:`openturns.experimental.SmolyakExperiment` class.

# %%
# We see that the multi-indices have a sum which is equal to either 3 or 4.
# In other words, these multi-indices belong to two different layers of
# constant 1-norms.
#
# In order to see how this evolves depending on the level of the quadrature,
# the following function creates a 2D plot of the set of multi-indices.

# We see that when the level increases, the set of Smolyak multi-indices
# correspond to two different layers of constant 1-norm.
