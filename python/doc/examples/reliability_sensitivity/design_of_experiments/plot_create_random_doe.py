# Random designs of experiments can be generated from probability distributions.

# The Monte Carlo design of experiments
# -------------------------------------
#
# We build the experiment  with the :class:`~openturns.MonteCarloExperiment` class :

# %%
# We draw the design of experiments as a :class:`~openturns.Cloud`

# %%
# Latin Hypercube Sampling
# ------------------------
#
# We build the LHS design of experiments with the :class:`~openturns.LHSExperiment` class :
experiment = ot.LHSExperiment(distribution, size)
sample = experiment.generate()

# %%
# We draw the LHS design of experiments as a cloud :
