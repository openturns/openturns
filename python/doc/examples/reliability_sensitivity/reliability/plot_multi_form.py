# design points.

# %%
# We consider a standard bivariate Gaussian random vector :math:`X = (X_1, X_2)` :
dim = 2
dist = ot.Normal(dim)

# %%
# We can draw the bidimensional PDF of the distribution `dist` over :math:`[-5,5] \times [-5,5]` :
ot.ResourceMap_SetAsUnsignedInteger("Contour-DefaultLevelsNumber", 8)
graphPDF = dist.drawPDF([-5, -5], [5, 5])
graphPDF.setTitle(r'2D-PDF of the input variables $(X_1, X_2)$')
graphPDF.setXTitle(r'$x_1$')
graphPDF.setYTitle(r'$x_2$')
graphPDF.setLegendPosition("bottomright")
view = otv.View(graphPDF)

# %%
# We then define a model :math:`f` which maps a 2D-vector X = (X_1,X_2) to a
# scalar output `Y = f(X)`.
f = ot.SymbolicFunction(['x0', 'x1'], ['5.0-x1-0.5*(x0-0.1)^2'])

graphModel.setXTitle(r'$x_2$')
graphModel.setTitle(r'Isolines of the model : $Y = f(X)$')
view = otv.View(graphModel)


# %%
# We create random vectors for the input and output variables :
X = ot.RandomVector(dist)
Y = ot.CompositeRandomVector(f, X)


# %%
# The failure domain :math:`\mathcal{D}` is :math:`\mathcal{D} = \{ x=(x_1, x_2) \in \mathbb{R}^2 / f(x) \geq 0 \}`
failureEvent = ot.ThresholdEvent(Y, ot.Less(), 0.0)


# %%
# We shall represent the failure domain event using a :class:`~openturns.Contour` object.

# %%
# In the physical space the failure domain boundary is the dashed black curve. We recall that one of
# the steps of the FORM method is to find the closest point of the failure domain boundary to the origin.
# Here we see that the symmetry of the domain implies that two points exist, one in the :math:`x_1 \geq 0` half-space and the other in the :math:`x_1 \leq 0` half-space.


# %%
# We build the :class:`~openturns.MultiFORM` algorithm in a similar fashion as the :class:`~openturns.FORM` algorithm. We choose an optimization solver, here the Cobyla solver, and a starting point, the mean
# of the distribution `dist`.
solver = ot.Cobyla()
starting_pt = dist.getMean()
algo = ot.MultiFORM(solver, failureEvent, starting_pt)


# %%
# We are ready to run the algorithm and store the result in the :class:`~openturns.MultiFORM` class :
algo.run()
result = algo.getResult()

# %%
# We have access to the results with the getFORMResultCollection method which produces a collection of :class:`~openturns.FORMResult` :
coll = result.getFORMResultCollection()

# %%
# The length of this collection is the number of design points :
n_design_pts = len(coll)
print("Number of design points :", n_design_pts)


# %%
# We have access to the design points with the getPhysicalSpaceDesignPoint method for each element of
# the collection `coll`.
designPointPhysicalSpace1 = coll[0].getPhysicalSpaceDesignPoint()
designPointPhysicalSpace2 = coll[1].getPhysicalSpaceDesignPoint()

print(coll[1].getPhysicalSpaceDesignPoint())

# %%
# We visualize them on the previous graph with red circle dots.

# %%
# We recall that the FORM approximate is based on the substitution of the failure domain by the half-space defined by the tangent at the design point. Here we can clearly see that this would miss half of the information. That is why both design points are needed.

# %%
# For each design point we have a probability associated to the approximation by the half-space :
pf1 = coll[0].getEventProbability()
pf2 = coll[1].getEventProbability()

# %%
# The probability of failure is the given by the :meth:`~openturns.MultiFORMResult.getEventProbability` which is the sum of the two previous probabilities `pf1` and `pf2` :
pf = result.getEventProbability()
print("Probability of failure : ", pf)
print("    wrt design point 1 : ", pf1)
print("    wrt design point 2 : ", pf2)
