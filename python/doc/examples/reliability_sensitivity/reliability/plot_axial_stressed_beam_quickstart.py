Estimate a probability with Monte-Carlo on axial stressed beam: a quick start guide to reliability
==================================================================================================
"""
# %%
#
# The goal of this example is to show a simple practical example of probability estimation in a reliability study with the `ProbabilitySimulationAlgorithm` class. The `ThresholdEvent` is used to define the event. We use the Monte-Carlo method thanks to the `MonteCarloExperiment` class to estimate this probability and its confidence interval.
# We use the :ref:`axial stressed beam <use-case-stressed-beam>` model as an illustrative example.


# %%
# Definition of the model
# -----------------------

# %%
import openturns as ot
import numpy as np
import openturns.viewer as viewer
from matplotlib import pylab as plt
ot.Log.Show(ot.Log.NONE)

# %%
# We load the model from the usecases module :
from openturns.usecases import stressed_beam as stressed_beam
sm = stressed_beam.AxialStressedBeam()

# %%
# The limit state function is defined as a symbolic function in the `model` parameter of the `AxialStressedBeam` data class : 
limitStateFunction = sm.model

# %%
# Before using the function within an algorithm, we check that the limit state function is correctly evaluated.

# %%
x = [3.e6, 750.]
print('x=', x)
print('G(x)=', limitStateFunction(x))

# %%
# Probabilistic model
# -------------------

# %%
# We load the first marginal, a univariate `LogNormal` distribution, parameterized by its mean and standard deviation :
R = sm.distribution_R

# %%
# We draw the PDF of the first marginal.
graph = R.drawPDF()
view = viewer.View(graph)

# %%
# Our second marginal is a `Normal` univariate distribution :
F = sm.distribution_F

# %%
# We draw the PDF of the second marginal.
graph = F.drawPDF()
view = viewer.View(graph)

# %%
# In order to create the input distribution, we use the `ComposedDistribution` class which associates the distribution marginals and a copula. If no copula is supplied to the constructor, it selects the independent copula as default. That is implemented in the data class :

# %%
myDistribution = sm.distribution

# %%
# We create a `RandomVector` from the `Distribution`, which will then be fed to the limit state function.

# %%
inputRandomVector = ot.RandomVector(myDistribution)

# %%
# Finally we create a `CompositeRandomVector` by associating the limit state function with the input random vector.

# %%
outputRandomVector = ot.CompositeRandomVector(limitStateFunction, inputRandomVector)

# %%
# Exact computation
# -----------------

# %%
# The simplest method is to perform an exact computation based on the arithmetic of distributions.

# %%
D = 0.02

# %%
G = R-F/(D**2/4 * np.pi)

# %%
G.computeCDF(0.)

# %%
# This is the exact result from the description of this example.

# %%
# Distribution of the output
# --------------------------

# %%
# Plot the distribution of the output.

# %%
sampleSize = 500
sampleG = outputRandomVector.getSample(sampleSize)
graph = ot.HistogramFactory().build(sampleG).drawPDF()
view = viewer.View(graph)

# %%
# Estimate the probability with Monte-Carlo
# -----------------------------------------

# %%
# We first create a `ThresholdEvent` based on the output `RandomVector`, the operator and the threshold.

# %%
myEvent = ot.ThresholdEvent(outputRandomVector, ot.Less(), 0.0)

# %%
# The `ProbabilitySimulationAlgorithm` is the main tool to estimate a probability. It is based on a specific design of experiments: in this example, we use the simplest of all, the `MonteCarloExperiment`. 

# %%
maximumCoV = 0.05 # Coefficient of variation
maximumNumberOfBlocks = 100000

experiment = ot.MonteCarloExperiment()
algoMC = ot.ProbabilitySimulationAlgorithm(myEvent, experiment)
algoMC.setMaximumOuterSampling(maximumNumberOfBlocks)
algoMC.setBlockSize(1)
algoMC.setMaximumCoefficientOfVariation(maximumCoV)

# %%
# In order to gather statistics about the algorithm, we get the initial number of function calls (this is not mandatory, but will prove to be convenient later in the study).

# %%
initialNumberOfCall = limitStateFunction.getEvaluationCallsNumber()

# %%
# Now comes the costly part: the `run` method performs the required simulations. The algorithm stops when the coefficient of variation of the probability estimate becomes lower than 0.5.

# %%
algoMC.run()

# %%
# We can then get the results of the algorithm. 

# %%
result = algoMC.getResult()
probability = result.getProbabilityEstimate()
numberOfFunctionEvaluations = limitStateFunction.getEvaluationCallsNumber() - initialNumberOfCall
print('Number of calls to the limit state =', numberOfFunctionEvaluations)
print('Pf = ', probability)
print('CV =', result.getCoefficientOfVariation())

# %%
# The `drawProbabilityConvergence` method plots the probability estimate depending on the number of function evaluations. The order of convergence is :math:`O \left( 1/N^2 \right)` with :math:`N` being the number of function evaluations. This is why we use a logarithmic scale for the X axis of the graphics.

# %%
graph = algoMC.drawProbabilityConvergence()
graph.setLogScale(ot.GraphImplementation.LOGX)
view = viewer.View(graph)

# %%
# We see that the 95% confidence interval becomes smaller and smaller and stabilizes at the end of the simulation.
#
# In order to compute the confidence interval, we use the `getConfidenceLength` method, which returns the length of the interval. In order to compute the bounds of the interval, we divide this length by 2.

# %%
alpha = 0.05

# %%
pflen = result.getConfidenceLength(1-alpha)
print("%.2f%% confidence interval = [%f,%f]" % ((1-alpha)*100,probability-pflen/2,probability+pflen/2))

# %%
# This interval is consistent with the exact probability :math:`P_f=0.02920`.

# %%
# Appendix: derivation of the failure probability
# -----------------------------------------------
#
# The failure probability is: 
#
# .. math::
#    P_f = \text{Prob}(R-S \leq 0) = \int_{r-s \leq 0} f_{R, S}(r, s)drds
# 
#
# where :math:`f_{R, S}` is the probability distribution function of the random vector :math:`(R,S)`.
# If R and S are independent, then: 
#
# .. math::
#    f_{R, S}(r, s) = f_R(r) f_S(s)
# 
#
# for any :math:`r,s\in\mathbb{R}`, 
# where :math:`f_S` is the probability distribution function of the random variable :math:`S` and :math:`f_R` is the probability distribution function of the random variable :math:`R`.
# Therefore,
#
# .. math::
#    P_f = \int_{r-s \leq 0} f_R(r) f_S(s) drds.
# 
#
# This implies:
#
# .. math::
#    P_f = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \left(\int_{r \leq s} f_R(r) dr \right) f_S(s) ds.
# 
# Therefore,
#
# .. math::
#    P_f = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}f_S(s)F_R(s)ds
# 
#
# where :math:`F_R` is the cumulative distribution function of the random variable :math:`R`.
