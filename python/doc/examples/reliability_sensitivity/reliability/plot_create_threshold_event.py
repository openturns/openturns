Create a threshold event
========================

# %%
# Abstract
# --------
#
# We present in this example the creation and the use of a :class:`~openturns.ThresholdEvent` to estimate a simple integral.
#
import openturns as ot
import openturns.viewer as otv
from matplotlib import pylab as plt


# %%
# We consider a standard Gaussian random vector :math:`X` and build a random vector from this distribution.
distX = ot.Normal()
vecX = ot.RandomVector(distX)

# %%
# We consider the simple model :math:`f:x \mapsto |x|` and consider the output random variable :math:`Y = f(X)`.
f = ot.SymbolicFunction(["x1"], ["abs(x1)"])
vecY = ot.CompositeRandomVector(f, vecX)

# %%
# We define a very simple :class:`~openturns.ThresholdEvent` which happpens whenever :math:`|X| < 1.0` :
thresholdEvent = ot.ThresholdEvent(vecY, ot.Less(), 1.0)

# %%
# For the normal distribution, it is a well-known fact that the values lower than one standard deviation (here exactly 1)
# away from the mean (here 0) account roughly for 68.27% of the set.
# So the probability of the event is:
#
print("Probability of the event : %.4f" % 0.6827)

# %%
# We can also use a basic estimator to get the probability of the event by drawing samples from the initial distribution `distX` and counting those which realize the event:
print(
    "Probability of the event (event sampling) : %.4f"
    % thresholdEvent.getSample(1000).computeMean()[0]
)


# %%
# The geometric interpretation is simply the area under the PDF of the standard normal distribution for :math:`x \in [-1,1]` which we draw thereafter.
