# %%
# Position of the problem
# -----------------------
#
# We consider a bivariate random vector :math:`X = (X_1, X_2)` with the following independent marginals :
#
# - an exponential distribution with parameter :math:`\lambda=1`, :math:`X_1 \sim \mathcal{E}(1.0)` ;
# - a standard unit gaussian :math:`X_2 \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)`.
#
# The support of the input vector is :math:`[0, +\infty[ \times \mathbb{R}`
#

# %%
distX1 = ot.Exponential(1.0)
distX2 = ot.Normal()
distX = ot.ComposedDistribution([distX1, distX2])


# %%
# We can draw the bidimensional PDF of the distribution `distX` over :math:`[0,-10] \times [10,10]` :
ot.ResourceMap_SetAsUnsignedInteger("Contour-DefaultLevelsNumber", 8)
graphPDF = distX.drawPDF([0, -10], [10, 10])
graphPDF.setTitle(r'2D-PDF of the input variables $(X_1, X_2)$')
graphPDF.setXTitle(r'$x_1$')
graphPDF.setYTitle(r'$x_2$')
graphPDF.setLegendPosition("bottomright")
view = otv.View(graphPDF)


# %%
# We consider the model :math:`f : (x_1, x_2) \mapsto x_1 x_2` which maps the random input vector :math:`X` to the output variable :math:`Y=f(X) \in \mathbb{R}`. We also draw the isolines of the model `f`.
#
f = ot.SymbolicFunction(['x1', 'x2'], ['x1 * x2'])
graphModel = f.draw([0.0, -10.0], [10.0, 10.0])
graphModel.setXTitle(r'$x_1$')
graphModel.setXTitle(r'$x_2$')
graphModel.setTitle(r'Isolines of the model : $Y = f(X)$')
view = otv.View(graphModel)


# %%
# We want to estimate the probability :math:`P_f` of the output variable to be greater than a prescribed threshold :math:`s=10` : this is the failure event. This probability is simply expressed as an integral :
#
# .. math::
#
#    P_f = \int_{\mathcal{D}} \mathbf{1}_{\mathcal{D}}(x) df_{X_1,X_2}(x)
#
# where :math:`\mathcal{D} = \{ (x_1, x_2) \in [0,+\infty[ \times \mathbb{R} / x_1 x_2 \geq s \}` is the failure domain.
# In the general case the probability density function :math:`f_{X_1,X_2}` and the domain of integration :math:`\mathcal{D}` are difficult to handle.

# %%
# We first define RandomVector objects and the failure event associated to the ouput random variable.
vectorX = ot.RandomVector(distX)
vectorY = ot.CompositeRandomVector(f, vectorX)
s = 10.0
event = ot.ThresholdEvent(vectorY, ot.Greater(), s)


# %%
# This event can easily be represented with a 1D curve as it is a branch of an hyperbole.
# If :math:`y =  x_1 x_2 = 10.0`, then the boundary of the domain of failure is the curve :
#
# .. math::
#
#    h : x_1 \mapsto \frac{10.0}{x_1}
#

# %%
# We shall represent this curve using a :class:`~openturns.Contour` object.

# We can superimpose the event boundary with the 2D-PDF ot the input variables :
#
mycontour.setColor("black")
mycontour.setLabels(["event"])
graphPDF.add(mycontour)
graphPDF.setLegendPosition("bottomright")
view = otv.View(graphPDF)

# %%
# From the previous figure we observe that in the failure domain the PDF takes small (and even very small) values. Consequently the probability of the failure, the integral :math:`P_f` is also expected to be small. The FORM/SORM methods estimate this kind of integral.
#

# %%
# The FORM approximation
# ----------------------
#
# The basic steps of the FORM (or SORM) algorithm are :
#
# - an isoprobabilistic transform ;
# - finding the design point : that is the nearest point wrt the origin in the standard space ;
# - estimating the probability integral.
#
# As mentionned, both the density function and the domain of integration are complex in general.
# The first step of the FORM method makes the density easier to work with and the second step tackles
# the domain of integration problem.
#
# Variable transform
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#

# %%
# OpenTURNS has several isoprobabilistic transforms and the FORM/SORM classes implement the Generalized
# Nataf and Rosenblatt transforms. In this case the `distX` distribution is not elliptical so the default method is the Rosenblatt transform.
#
print("Is Elliptical ? ", distX.isElliptical())

# %%
# We seek an isoprobabilistic transform :math:`T` such as
#
# .. math::
#    T : X \mapsto Z
#
# where each component of :math:`Z` is a standard unit gaussian.
#
# The isoprobabilistic transform and its inverse are methods of the distribution `distX` :
transformation = distX.getIsoProbabilisticTransformation()
inverseTransformation = distX.getInverseIsoProbabilisticTransformation()

# %%
# The main goal of this step is to work with a simpler probability density function of
# the input variables as they will be standard gaussian unit and uncorrelated. The domain of
# integration will still be complicated but will be handled with a well chosen approximate.
#

# %%
# We detail the Rosenblatt transform in this simple case.
# In this example we consider independent variables so the transform is simpler, we only have to
# perform the transformation on each variable. For the second one is already a standard unit gaussian
# we transform the first variable only.
#

# %%
# We draw a realization of the random input vector. This point is said to be in the physical space.
# We shall focus on the first component.
xi = vectorX.getRealization()

# %%
# The first step of the Rosenblatt transform is to build a random variable :math:`u` with a uniform law in ]0,1[.
# This is done through an evaluation of the CDF of `distX1` at the given point in the physical space.
# Once again, please note that the second component is left unchanged.
#
ui = [distX1.computeCDF(xi[0]), xi[1]]

# %%
# The second step is to build a standard unit gaussian from a uniform variable. This is done by a
# simple call to the probit function. The point `zi` is said to be in the standard space.
zi = [-ot.Normal().computeInverseSurvivalFunction(ui[0])[0], ui[1]]

# %%
# The sought transform then maps a point in the physical space to the standard space :
print(xi, "->", ui, "->", zi)


# %%
# We also build the isoprobabilistic transform :math:`T_1` and its inverse :math:`T_1^{-1}` for the
# first marginal :
transformX1 = distX1.getIsoProbabilisticTransformation()
inverseTransformX1 = distX1.getInverseIsoProbabilisticTransformation()

# %%
# We can check the result of our experiment against :
#
# - the 2D-transform :math:`T` ;
# - the 1D-transform :math:`T_1` and the second component unchanged ;
#
# and observe the results are the same.
zi1D = [transformX1([xi[0]])[0], xi[1]]
zi2D = transformation(xi)
print("zi = ", zi)
print("zi1D = ", zi1D)
print("zi2D = ", zi2D)


# %%
# We can represent the boundary of the event in the standard space : that is a composition of the
# hyperbole :math:`h : x \mapsto 10/x` and the inverse transform :math:`T_1^{-1}` defined by
# :math:`inverseTransformX1`.

view = otv.View(graphStandardSpace)

# %%
# The design point
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# The FORM and SORM methods assume that the failure probability integral has its support in
# the vicinity of the closest point of the domain to the origin.
# Then the second step of the method is to find this point, *the design point*, through a
# minimization problem under constraints.
#

# %%
# We configure the Cobyla solver that we use for the optimization :
solver = ot.Cobyla()
solver.setMaximumIterationNumber(10000)
solver.setMaximumAbsoluteError(1.0e-3)
solver.setMaximumRelativeError(1.0e-3)
solver.setMaximumResidualError(1.0e-3)

# %%
# We build the FORM algorithm with its basic constructor. The starting point for the optimization
# algorithm is the mean of the input variables.
algoFORM = ot.FORM(solver, event, distX.getMean())

# %%
# We are ready to run the algorithm and store the result :

# We can get the Hasofer index with the `getHasoferReliabilityIndex` method which is the distance of the design point to the origin :
betaHL = result.getHasoferReliabilityIndex()
print("Hasofer index : ", betaHL)

# We visualize it on the previous graph.

# %%
# Estimating the failure probability integral
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# The last step of the FORM algorithm is to replace the domain of integration by the half-space at
# the design point. In this simple example the half-space is delimited by the tangent at the design
# point in the standard space.
#
# The expression of the failure domain boundary in the standard space is the composition of the
# hyperbole :math:`h:x \mapsto 10/x` and the inverse transform on the first variable. We can compute
# the gradient (here the first derivative of a 1D function :math:`h(u_0)` ) at any given point with the
# getGradient method :

# %%
u0 = [designPointStandardSpace[0]]
du0 = failureBoundaryStandardSpace.getGradient().gradient(u0)
print("abscissa of the design point u0  = ", u0[0])
print("value of the failure boundary at u0 = ",
      failureBoundaryStandardSpace(u0)[0])
print("value of the gradient of the failure boundary at u0 = ", du0[0, 0])


# %%
# In the standard space the equation of the tangent :math:`\Pi_{u_0}(x)` is given by
#
# .. math::
#
#    \Pi_{u_0}(x) = (h \circ T^{-1}) (u_0) + \frac{d}{dx} (h \circ T^{-1}) (u_0) (x-u_0)
#
x = np.linspace(1.1, 5.0, 100)
hyperplane = failureBoundaryStandardSpace(u0)[0] + du0[0, 0] * (x-u0)

curveHyperplane.setLineStyle("dashed")
curveHyperplane.setColor("green")
graphStandardSpace.add(curveHyperplane)
view = otv.View(graphStandardSpace)

# %%
# In the standard space the PDF of the input variables is rotationally invariant so
#
# .. math::
#
#    P_f \approx E(\beta_{HL}),
#
# where :math:`E(.)` is the survival function of the standard unit gaussian.
#
pf = ot.Normal().computeSurvivalFunction(betaHL)
print("FORM : Pf = ", pf)

# %%
# This proability of failure is the one computed in the FORMResult and obtained with the `getEventProbability` method :
pf = result.getEventProbability()
print("Probability of failure (FORM) Pf = ", pf)


# %%
# The SORM approximation
# ----------------------
#
# The SORM approximate uses an osculating paraboloid instead of the half-space delimited by the
# tangent at the design point. In this case it is a simple parabola we can obtain through Taylor expansion at the design point.
# However, in the general case one has to manipulate the gradient and the hessian in the
# standard space which is cumbersome.
#

# %%
# We need the value of the second derivative of the failure boundary function at the design point in
# the standard space :
u0 = [designPointStandardSpace[0]]
d2u0 = failureBoundaryStandardSpace.getHessian().hessian(u0)
print("abscissa of the design point u0  = ", u0[0])
print("value of the hessian of the failure boundary at u0 = ", d2u0[0, 0, 0])


# %%
# In the standard space the equation of the osculating parabola :math:`\mathcal{P}_{u_0}(x)` at :math:`u_0` is given by
#
# .. math::
#
#    \mathcal{P}_{u_0}(x) = h \circ T^{-1} (u_0) + \frac{d}{dx} (h \circ T^{-1})(u_0) (x-u_0) + \frac{1}{2} \frac{d^2}{dx^2} (h \circ T^{-1})(u_0) (x-u_0)^2
#
x = np.linspace(1.1, 5.0, 100)
parabola = failureBoundaryStandardSpace(
    u0)[0] + du0[0, 0] * (x-u0) + 0.5 * d2u0[0, 0, 0] * (x-u0)**2
curveParabola = ot.Curve(x, parabola, r'$\mathcal{P}_{u_0}$ (SORM)')
curveParabola.setLineStyle("dashed")
curveParabola.setColor("orange")
graphStandardSpace.add(curveParabola)
view = otv.View(graphStandardSpace)


# %%
# The next step is to estimate the principal curvatures of the osculating paraboloid.
#
# For any regular function :math:`g` the curvature :math:`\kappa(x_0)` at the point :math:`x_0` in cartesian coordinates reads as
#
# .. math::
#
#    \kappa(x_0) = \frac{g''(x_0)}{(1+[g'(x_0)]^2)^{3/2}}.
#
# For the oscilating parabola of concern we use the gradient and hessian previously computed :
#
curvature = (d2u0[0, 0, 0]) / (1 + (du0[0, 0]) ** 2)**(3/2)
print("Curvature (analytic formula) = ", curvature)


# %%
# We build the SORM algorithm and run it :
algoSORM = ot.SORM(solver, event, distX.getMean())
algoSORM.run()

# %%
# The SORM result is obtained with the `getResult` method :
resultSORM = algoSORM.getResult()

# %%
# The principal curvatures of the osculating paraboloid at the design point is obtained by the
# `getSortedCurvatures` method :
print("Curvature (estimated) = ", resultSORM.getSortedCurvatures()[1])


# %%
# Once the curvature is obtained there are several ways of approximating the failure probability :math:`P_f`. OpenTURNS implements the Breitung, Hohenbichler and Tvedt estimates.
#
# For instance, the Breitung approximation gives
#
# .. math::
#
#    P_f \approx E(\beta_{HL}) \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\beta_{HL}\kappa}}
#
coeff = (1.0 + betaHL*curvature) ** (-0.5)
pf = (1.0 - ot.Normal().computeCDF(betaHL)) * coeff
print("SORM : Pf = ", pf)

# %%
# We can compare with the different estimators implemented in OpenTURNS :
pfBreitung = resultSORM.getEventProbabilityBreitung()
pfHohenbichler = resultSORM.getEventProbabilityHohenbichler()
pfTvedt = resultSORM.getEventProbabilityTvedt()

print("Probability of failure (SORM Breintung) Pf = ", pfBreitung)

print("Probability of failure (SORM Tvedt) Pf = ", pfTvedt)
