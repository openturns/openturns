Probability estimation: directional simulation
==============================================
"""
# %%
# In this example we estimate a failure probability with the directional simulation algorithm provided by the `DirectionalSampling` class.

# %%
# Introduction
# ------------
#
# The directional simulation algorithm  operates in the standard space based on:
#
# 1. a *root strategy* to evaluate the nearest failure point along each direction and take the contribution of each direction to the failure event probability into account. The available strategies are:
#    - `RiskyAndFast`
#    - `MediumSafe`
#    - `SafeAndSlow`
#  
# 2. a *sampling strategy* to choose directions in the standard space. The available strategies are:
#    - `RandomDirection`
#    - `OrthogonalDirection`
#
# Let us consider the analytical example of the cantilever beam described :ref:`here <use-case-cantilever-beam>`.

ot.Log.Show(ot.Log.NONE)

# %%
# We load the model from the usecases module :
from openturns.usecases import cantilever_beam as cantilever_beam
cb = cantilever_beam.CantileverBeam()

# %%
# We load the joint probability distribution of the input parameters :
distribution = cb.distribution

# %%
# We load the model giving the displacement at the end of the beam :
model = cb.model

# %%
# We create the event whose probability we want to estimate.

vect = ot.RandomVector(distribution)
G = ot.CompositeRandomVector(model, vect)
event = ot.ThresholdEvent(G, ot.Greater(), 0.30)

# Root finding algorithm.

# %%
solver = ot.Brent()
rootStrategy = ot.MediumSafe(solver)

# %%
# Direction sampling algorithm.

# %%
samplingStrategy = ot.OrthogonalDirection()

# %%
# Create a simulation algorithm.

algo = ot.DirectionalSampling(event, rootStrategy, samplingStrategy)
algo.setMaximumCoefficientOfVariation(0.1)
algo.setMaximumOuterSampling(40000)
algo.setConvergenceStrategy(ot.Full())
algo.run()

# Retrieve results.
