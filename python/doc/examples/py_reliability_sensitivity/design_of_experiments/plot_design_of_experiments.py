Various design of experiments in OpenTURNS
==========================================

# The goal of this example is to present several design of experiments available in OpenTURNS. 

# %%
# Distribution
# ------------

# %%

import openturns.viewer as otv

# %%
# Monte-Carlo sampling in 2D
# --------------------------

# %%
dim = 2
X = [ot.Uniform()] * dim
distribution = ot.ComposedDistribution(X)
bounds = distribution.getRange()

# %%
sampleSize = 10
sample = distribution.getSample(sampleSize)

# %%
fig = otv.PlotDesign(sample, bounds);

# %%
# We see that there a empty zones in the input space. 

# %%
# Monte-Carlo sampling in 3D
# --------------------------

# %%
dim = 3
X = [ot.Uniform()] * dim
distribution = ot.ComposedDistribution(X)
bounds = distribution.getRange()

# %%
sampleSize = 10
sample = distribution.getSample(sampleSize)

# %%
fig = otv.PlotDesign(sample, bounds)
fig.set_size_inches(10, 10)

# %%
# Latin Hypercube Sampling
# ------------------------

# %%
distribution = ot.ComposedDistribution([ot.Uniform()]*3)
samplesize = 5
experiment = ot.LHSExperiment(distribution, samplesize, False, False)
sample = experiment.generate()

# %%
# In order to see the LHS property, we need to set the bounds. 

# %%
bounds = distribution.getRange()

# %%
fig = otv.PlotDesign(sample, bounds)
fig.set_size_inches(10, 10)

# %%
# We see that each column or row exactly contains one single point. This shows that a LHS design of experimens has good 1D projection properties, and, hence, is a good candidate for a space filling design. 

# %%
# Optimized LHS
# -------------

# %%
distribution = ot.ComposedDistribution([ot.Uniform()]*3)
samplesize = 10

# %%
bounds = distribution.getRange()

# %%
lhs = ot.LHSExperiment(distribution, samplesize)
lhs.setAlwaysShuffle(True) # randomized
space_filling = ot.SpaceFillingC2()
temperatureProfile = ot.GeometricProfile(10.0, 0.95, 1000)
algo = ot.SimulatedAnnealingLHS(lhs, temperatureProfile, space_filling)
# optimal design
sample = algo.generate()

# %%
fig = otv.PlotDesign(sample, bounds)
fig.set_size_inches(10, 10)

# %%
# We see that this LHS is optimized in the sense that it fills the space more evenly than a non-optimized does in general. 

# %%
# Sobol' low discrepancy sequence
# -------------------------------

# %%
dim = 2
distribution = ot.ComposedDistribution([ot.Uniform()]*dim)
bounds = distribution.getRange()

# %%
sequence = ot.SobolSequence(dim)

# %%
samplesize = 2**5 # Sobol' sequences are in base 2
experiment = ot.LowDiscrepancyExperiment(sequence, distribution, samplesize, False)
sample = experiment.generate()

# %%
samplesize

# %%
subdivisions = [2**2, 2**1]
fig = otv.PlotDesign(sample, bounds, subdivisions);
fig.set_size_inches(6, 6)

# %%
# We have elementary intervals in 2 dimensions, each having a volume equal to 1/8. Since there are 32 points, the Sobol' sequence is so that each elementary interval contains exactly 32/8 = 4 points. Notice that each elementary interval is closed on the left (or bottom) and open on the right (or top). 

# %%
# Halton low discrepancy sequence
# -------------------------------

# %%
dim = 2
distribution = ot.ComposedDistribution([ot.Uniform()]*dim)
bounds = distribution.getRange()

# %%
sequence = ot.HaltonSequence(dim)

# %%
samplesize = 2**2 * 3**2 # Halton sequence uses prime numbers 2 and 3 in two dimensions.
experiment = ot.LowDiscrepancyExperiment(sequence, distribution, samplesize, False)
sample = experiment.generate()

# %%
samplesize

# %%
subdivisions = [2**2, 3]
fig = otv.PlotDesign(sample, bounds, subdivisions);
fig.set_size_inches(6, 6)

# %%
# We have elementary intervals in 2 dimensions, each having a volume equal to 1/12. Since there are 36 points, the Halton sequence is so that each elementary interval contains exactly 36/12 = 3 points. Notice that each elementary interval is closed on the left (or bottom) and open on the right (or top).
