"""
Create a design of experiments with discrete and continuous variables
=====================================================================
"""
# %%
# In this example we present how to create a design of experiments when one (or several) of the marginals are discrete.

from __future__ import print_function
import openturns as ot
import openturns.viewer as viewer
from matplotlib import pylab as plt
ot.Log.Show(ot.Log.NONE)

# %%
# To create the first marginal of the distribution, we select a univariate discrete distribution. Some of them, like the `Bernoulli` or `Geometric` distributions, are implemented in the library as classes. In this example however, we pick the `UserDefined` distribution that assigns equal weights to the values -2, -1, 1 and 2.

# %%
sample = ot.Sample([[-2.], [-1.], [1.], [2.]])
sample

# %%
X0 = ot.UserDefined(sample)

# %%
# For the second marginal, we pick a Gaussian distribution.

# %%
X1 = ot.Normal()

# %%
# Create the multivariate distribution from its marginals and an independent copula.

# %%
distribution = ot.ComposedDistribution([X0,X1])

# %%
# Create the design.

# %%
size = 100
experiment = ot.MonteCarloExperiment(distribution, size)
sample = experiment.generate()

# %%
# Plot the design.

# %%
graph = ot.Graph("MonteCarloExperiment", "x0", "x1", True, "")
cloud = ot.Cloud(sample, "blue", "fsquare", "")
graph.add(cloud)
view = viewer.View(graph)

# %%
# Any other type of design of experiments can be generated based on this distribution. The following example shows a LHS experiment.

# %%
size = 100
alwaysShuffle = True
randomShift = True
experiment = ot.LHSExperiment(distribution, size, alwaysShuffle, randomShift)
sample = experiment.generate()

# %%
graph = ot.Graph("LHSExperiment", "x0", "x1", True, "")
cloud = ot.Cloud(sample, "blue", "fsquare", "")
graph.add(cloud)
view = viewer.View(graph)
plt.show()
