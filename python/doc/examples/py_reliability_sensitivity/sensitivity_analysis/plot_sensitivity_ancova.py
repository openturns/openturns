ANCOVA sensitivity indices
==========================
"""
# %%
# In this example we are going to use the ANCOVA decomposition to estimate sensitivity indices from a model with correlated inputs.
#
# ANCOVA allows to estimate the Sobol' indices, and thanks to a functional decomposition of the model it allows to separate the part of variance explained by a variable itself from the part of variance explained by a correlation which is due to its correlation with the other input parameters.
#
#
# In theory, ANCOVA indices range is :math:`\left[0; 1\right]` ; the closer to 1 the index is,
# the greater the model response sensitivity to the variable is.
# These indices are a sum of a physical part :math:`S_i^U` and correlated part :math:`S_i^C`.
# The correlation has a weak influence on the contribution of :math:`X_i`, if :math:`|S_i^C|`
# is low and :math:`S_i` is close to :math:`S_i^U`.
# On the contrary, the correlation has a strong influence on the contribution of
# the input :math:`X_i`, if :math:`|S_i^C|` is high and :math:`S_i` is close to :math:`S_i^C`.
#
# The ANCOVA indices :math:`S_i` evaluate the importance of one variable at a time
# (:math:`d` indices stored, with :math:`d` the input dimension of the model).
# The :math:`d` uncorrelated parts of variance of the output due to each input :math:`S_i^U`
# and the effects of the correlation are represented by the indices resulting
# from the subtraction of these two previous lists.
#
# To evaluate the indices, the library needs of a functional chaos result
# approximating the model response with uncorrelated inputs and a sample with
# correlated inputs used to compute the real values of the output.
