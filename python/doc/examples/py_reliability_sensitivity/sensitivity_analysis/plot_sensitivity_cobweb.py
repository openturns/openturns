"""
Cobweb graph as sensitivity tool
================================
"""
# %%
# The Cobweb graph enables to visualize all the combinations of the input
# variables which lead to a specific range of the output variable.
#
# Let us consider a model :math:`f: \mathbb{R}^n \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}`, where :math:`f(\underline{X}) = Y`.
#
# The graph requires to have an input sample :math:`X_s` and an output sample :math:`Y_s`.
#
# The first figure draws such a graph: each column represents one component
# :math:`X_i` of the input vector :math:`\underline{X}`.
# The last column represents the scalar output variable :math:`Y`.
# For each point :math:`\underline{X}^j`, each component :math:`X_i^j`
# is noted on its respective axe and the last mark is the one which corresponds to
# the associated :math:`Y^j`. A line joins all the marks. Thus, each point of the sample
# corresponds to a particular line on the graph.
#
# The scale of the axes are quantile based: each axe runs between 0 and 1 and each
# value is represented by its quantile with respect to its marginal empirical distribution.
#
# It is interesting to select, among those lines, the ones which correspond to a specific range of the output variable.
# These particular lines are colored differently.
# This specific range is defined in the quantile based scale of :math:`Y` or in its specific scale.
# In that second case, the range is automatically converted into a quantile based scale range.
