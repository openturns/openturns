FAST sensitivity indices
========================
"""
# %%
# This example will demonstrate how to quantify the correlation between the input
# variables and the output variable of a model using the FAST method,
# based upon the Fourier decomposition of the model response,
# which is a relevant alternative to the classical
# simulation approach for computing Sobol sensitivity indices.
#
# The FAST indices, like the Sobol indices, allow to
# evaluate the importance of a single variable or a specific set of variables.
#
# In theory, FAST indices range is :math:`\left[0; 1\right]` ; the closer to 1 the
# index is, the greater the model response sensitivity to the variable is.
#
# The FAST method compute the first and total order indices.
# The first order indices evaluate the importance of one variable at a time
# (:math:`d` indices, with :math:`d` the input dimension of the model).
#
# The :math:`d` total indices give the relative importance of every variables except
# the variable :math:`X_i`, for every variable.
