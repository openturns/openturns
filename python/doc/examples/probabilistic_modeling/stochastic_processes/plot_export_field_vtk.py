"""
Export a field to VTK
=====================
"""
# %%
# The objective here is to create a field and export it as a VTK file. A field is the agregation of a mesh :math:`\mathcal{M}` of a domain :math:`\mathcal{D} \in \mathbb{R}^n` and a sample of values in :math:`\mathbb{R}^d` associated to each vertex of the mesh.
#
# We note :math:`(\underline{t}_0, \dots, \underline{t}_{N-1})` the vertices of :math:`\mathcal{M}` and :math:`(\underline{x}_0, \dots, \underline{x}_{N-1})` the associated values in :math:`\mathbb{R}^d`.
#
# A field is stored in the *Field* object that stores the mesh and the values at each vertex of the mesh.
# It can be built from a mesh and values or as a realization of a stochastic process.
