# Create a gaussian process from a covariance model
# -------------------------------------------------
#
# In this paragraph we build a gaussian process from its covariance model.


# %%
# We first define a covariance model :

# %%
defaultDimension = 1
# Amplitude values
amplitude = [1.0]*defaultDimension
# Scale values
scale = [1.0]*defaultDimension
# Covariance model
myModel = ot.AbsoluteExponential(scale, amplitude)

# %%
# We define a mesh,
tmin = 0.0
step = 0.1
n = 11
myTimeGrid = ot.RegularGrid(tmin, step, n)

# %%
# and create the process :
process = ot.GaussianProcess(myModel, myTimeGrid)
print(process)

# %%
# We draw the first marginal of a sample of size 6 :
sample = process.getSample(6)
graph = sample.drawMarginal(0)

# %%
# Create a gaussian process from spectral density
# -----------------------------------------------
#
# In this paragraph we build a gaussian process from its spectral density.
#

# %%
# We first define a spectral model :
amplitude = [1.0, 2.0]
scale = [4.0, 5.0]
spatialCorrelation = ot.CorrelationMatrix(2)
spatialCorrelation[0, 1] = 0.8
mySpectralModel = ot.CauchyModel(scale, amplitude, spatialCorrelation)

# %%
# As usual we define a mesh,
myTimeGrid = ot.RegularGrid(0.0, 0.1, 20)

# %%
# and create the process thereafter
process = ot.SpectralGaussianProcess(mySpectralModel, myTimeGrid)
print(process)

# %%
# Eventually we draw the first marginal of a sample of size 6 :
sample = process.getSample(6)
graph = sample.drawMarginal(0)
graph.setTitle("First marginal of six realizations of the process")
