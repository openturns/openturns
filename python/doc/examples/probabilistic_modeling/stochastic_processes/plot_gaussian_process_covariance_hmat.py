"""
Create a gaussian process from a cov. model using HMatrix
=========================================================
"""
# %%
#
# In this basic example we build a gaussian process from its covariance model and use the `HMatrix` method as a sampling method.
# Several methods and parameters are presented to set the HMatrix compression.
# This is an advanced topic and we should highlight key ideas only in this example.

# Definition of the covariance model
# ----------------------------------
#
# We define our Gaussian process from its covariance model. We consider a Gaussian kernel with the following parameters.

# %%
dimension = 1
amplitude = [1.0] * dimension
scale = [1] * dimension
covarianceModel = ot.GeneralizedExponential(scale, amplitude, 2)

# %%
# We define the time grid on which we want to sample the Gaussian process.

# %%
tmin = 0.0
step = 0.01
n = 10001
timeGrid = ot.RegularGrid(tmin, step, n)

# %%
# Finally we define the Gaussian process.
process = ot.GaussianProcess(covarianceModel, timeGrid)
print(process)

# %%
# Basics on the HMatrix algebra
# -----------------------------
#
# The `HMatrix` framework uses efficient linear algebra techniques to speed-up the
# (Cholesky) factorization of the covariance matrix.
# This method can be tuned with several parameters. We should concentrate on the easiest ones.

# %%
# We set the sampling method to `HMAT` (default is the classical/dense case).
process.setSamplingMethod(ot.GaussianProcess.HMAT)


# %%
# The `HMatrix` framework uses an algebraic algorithm to compress sub-blocks of the matrix. Several algorithms are available and can be set from the ResourceMap key.
ot.ResourceMap.SetAsString("HMatrix-CompressionMethod",  "AcaRandom")

# %%
# There are two threshold used in the HMatrix framework. The `AssemblyEpsilon` is the most important one.
#
ot.ResourceMap.SetAsScalar("HMatrix-AssemblyEpsilon",  1e-7)
ot.ResourceMap.SetAsScalar("HMatrix-RecompressionEpsilon",  1e-7)


# %%
# Process sampling
# ----------------

# %%
# We eventually draw samples of this covariance model.
sample = process.getSample(6)
graph = sample.drawMarginal(0)
view = viewer.View(graph)
plt.show()

# %%
# We notice here that we are able to sample the covariance model over a mesh of size `10000`, which is usually tricky on a laptop. This is mainly due to the compression.
