# The objective here is to manipulate a multivariate stochastic process :math:`X: \Omega \times \mathcal{D} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d`, where :math:`\mathcal{D} \in \mathbb{R}^n` is discretized on the mesh :math:`\mathcal{M}` and exhibit some of the services exposed by the *Process* objects:
#
# - ask for the dimension, with the method getOutputDimension
# - ask for the mesh, with the method getMesh
# - ask for the mesh as regular 1-d mesh, with the getTimeGrid method
# - ask for a realization, with the method the getRealization method
# - ask for a continuous realization, with the getContinuousRealization method
# - ask for a sample of realizations, with the getSample method
# - ask for the normality of the process with the isNormal method
# - ask for the stationarity of the process with the isStationary method

# We create a mesh -a time grid- which is a RegularGrid :
tMin = 0.0
timeStep = 0.1
n = 100
time_grid = ot.RegularGrid(tMin, timeStep, n)
time_grid.setName('time')

# %%
# We create a Normal process :math:`X_t = (X_t^0, X_t^1, X_t^2)` in dimension 3 with an exponential covariance model.
# We define the amplitude and the scale of the `ExponentialModel`
scale = [4.0]
amplitude = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]

# %%
# We define a spatial correlation :
spatialCorrelation = ot.CorrelationMatrix(3)
spatialCorrelation[0, 1] = 0.8
spatialCorrelation[0, 2] = 0.6
spatialCorrelation[1, 2] = 0.1

# %%
# The covariance model is now created with :
myCovarianceModel = ot.ExponentialModel(scale, amplitude, spatialCorrelation)

# %%
# Eventually, the process is  built with :
process = ot.GaussianProcess(myCovarianceModel, time_grid)

# %%
# The dimension d of the process may be retrieved by
dim = process.getOutputDimension()
print("Dimension : %d" % dim)

# %%
# The underlying mesh of the process is obtained with the `getMesh` method :
mesh = process.getMesh()

# %%
# We have access to peculiar data of the mesh such as the corners :
minMesh = mesh.getVertices().getMin()[0]
maxMesh = mesh.getVertices().getMax()[0]

# %%
# We draw it :
graph = mesh.draw()
graph.setTitle("Time grid (mesh)")
graph.setXTitle("t")
graph.setYTitle("")
view = viewer.View(graph)


# %%
# We can get the time grid of the process when the mesh can be interpreted as a regular time grid :
print(process.getTimeGrid())


# %%
# A typical feature of a process is the generation of a realization of itself :
realization = process.getRealization()

# %%
# Here it is a sample of size :math:`100 \times 4` (100 time steps, 3 spatial cooordinates and the time variable). We are able to draw its marginals, for instance the first (index 0) one :math:`X_t^0`, against the time with no interpolation :
interpolate = False
graph = realization.drawMarginal(0, interpolate)
graph.setTitle("First marginal of a realization of the process")
graph.setXTitle("t")
graph.setYTitle(r"$X_t^0$")
view = viewer.View(graph)

# %%
# The same graph, but with interpolated values (default behaviour) :
graph = realization.drawMarginal(0)
graph.setTitle("First marginal of a realization of the process")
graph.setXTitle("t")
graph.setYTitle(r"$X_t^0$")
view = viewer.View(graph)


# %%
# We can build a function representing the process using P1-Lagrange interpolation (when not defined from a functional model).
continuousRealization = process.getContinuousRealization()

# %%
# Once again we draw its first marginal :
marginal0 = continuousRealization.getMarginal(0)
graph = marginal0.draw(minMesh, maxMesh)
graph.setTitle(
    "First marginal of a P1-Lagrange continuous realization of the process")
graph.setXTitle("t")
view = viewer.View(graph)

# %%
# Please note that the `marginal0` object is a function. Consequently we can
# evaluate it at any point of the domain, say :math:`t_0=3.5678`
t0 = 3.5678
print(t0, marginal0([t0]))


# %%
# Several realizations of the process may be determined at once :
number = 10
fieldSample = process.getSample(number)

# %%
# Let us draw them the first marginal)
graph = fieldSample.drawMarginal(0, False)
graph.setTitle("First marginal of 10 realizations of the process")
graph.setXTitle("t")
graph.setYTitle(r"$X_t^0$")
view = viewer.View(graph)

# %%
# Same graph, but with interpolated values :
graph = fieldSample.drawMarginal(0)
graph.setTitle("First marginal of 10 realizations of the process")
graph.setXTitle("t")
graph.setYTitle(r"$X_t^0$")
view = viewer.View(graph)


# %%
# Miscellanies
# ------------
#
# We can extract any marginal of the process with the `getMarginal` method.
# Beware the numerotation begins at 0 ! It may be not implemented yet for
# some processes.
# The extracted marginal is a 1D gaussian process :
print(process.getMarginal([1]))

# %%
# If we extract simultaneously two indices we build a 2D gaussian process :
print(process.getMarginal([0, 2]))

# %%
# We can check whether the process is normal or not :
print("Is normal ? ", process.isNormal())

# %%
# and the stationarity as well :
print("Is stationary ? ", process.isStationary())
