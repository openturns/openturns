"""
Transform a distribution
========================
"""
# %%
# In this example we are going to use distribution algebra and distribution transformation via functions.

# %%
from __future__ import print_function
import openturns as ot
import openturns.viewer as viewer
from matplotlib import pylab as plt
ot.Log.Show(ot.Log.NONE)

# %%
# We define some (classical) distributions :

# %%
distribution1 = ot.Uniform(0.0, 1.0)
distribution2 = ot.Uniform(0.0, 2.0)
distribution3 = ot.WeibullMin(1.5, 2.0)

# %%
# Sum & difference of distributions
# ---------------------------------
#
# It is easy to compute the sum of distributions. For example :

# %%
distribution = distribution1 + distribution2
print(distribution)
graph = distribution.drawPDF()
view = viewer.View(graph)

# %%
# We might also use substraction even with scalar values :

# %%
distribution = 3.0 - distribution3
print(distribution)
graph = distribution.drawPDF()
view = viewer.View(graph)

# %%
# Product & inverse
# -----------------
#
# We might also compute the product of two (or more) distributions. For example :

# %%
distribution = distribution1 * distribution2
print(distribution)
graph = distribution.drawPDF()
view = viewer.View(graph)

# %%
# We could also inverse a distribution :

# %%
distribution = 1 / distribution1
print(distribution)
graph = distribution.drawPDF()
view = viewer.View(graph)

# %%
# Or compute a ratio distribution :

# %%
ratio = distribution2 / distribution1
print(ratio)
graph = ratio.drawPDF()
view = viewer.View(graph)

# %%
# Transformation using functions
# ------------------------------
#
# The library provides methods to get the full distributions of `f(x)` where `f` can be equal to :
#
#  - `sin`,
#  - `asin`,
#  - `cos`,
#  - `acos`,
#  - `tan`,
#  - `atan`,
#  - `sinh`,
#  - `asinh`,
#  - `cosh`,
#  - `acosh`,
#  - `tanh`,
#  - `atanh`,
#  - `sqr` (for square),
#  - `inverse`,
#  - `sqrt`,
#  - `exp`,
#  - `log`/`ln`,
#  - `abs`,
#  - `cbrt`.
#
#
# For example for the usual `log` transformation :

# %%
graph = distribution1.log().drawPDF()
view = viewer.View(graph)

# %%
# And for the `log2` function :

# %%
f = ot.SymbolicFunction(['x'], ['log2(x)'])
f.setDescription(["X", "ln(X)"])
graph = ot.CompositeDistribution(f, distribution1).drawPDF()
view = viewer.View(graph)

# %%
# If one wants a specific method, user might rely on the :class:`~openturns.CompositeDistribution` class.

# Create a composite distribution
# -------------------------------
#
# In this paragraph we create a distribution defined as the push-forward distribution of a scalar distribution by a transformation.
#
# If we note :math:`\mathcal{L}_0` a scalar distribution, :math:`f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}` a mapping, then it is possible to create the push-forward distribution :math:`\mathcal{L}` defined by
#
# .. math::
#    \mathcal{L} = f(\mathcal{L}_0)
#

# %%
# We create a 1D normal distribution :
antecedent = ot.Normal()

# %%
# and a 1D transform :
f = ot.SymbolicFunction(['x'], ['sin(x)+cos(x)'])

# %%
# We then create the composite distribution :
distribution = ot.CompositeDistribution(f, antecedent)
graph = distribution.drawPDF()
view = viewer.View(graph)

# %%
# We can also build a distribution with the simplified construction :
distribution = antecedent.exp()
graph = distribution.drawPDF()
view = viewer.View(graph)

# %%
# and by using chained operators :
distribution = antecedent.abs().sqrt()
graph = distribution.drawPDF()
view = viewer.View(graph)

# %%
# Display all figures
plt.show()
