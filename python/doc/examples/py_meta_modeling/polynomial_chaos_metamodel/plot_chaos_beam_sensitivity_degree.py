Polynomial chaos is sensitive to the degree
===========================================

# Introduction
# ------------
#
# In this example, we observe the sensitivity of the polynomial chaos expansion to the total degree of the polynomial. More precisely, we observe how this impacts the :math:`Q^2` predictivity coefficient.
#
# We consider the example of the cantilever beam. We create a sparse polynomial chaos with a linear enumeration rule and the family of orthogonal polynomials corresponding to each input variable.

# We see that when the degree of the polynomial increases, the Q2 coefficient decreases. We also see that the sparsity rate increases: while the basis size grows rapidly with the degree, the algorithm selects a smaller fraction of this basis. This shows that the algorithm performs its task of selecting relevant coefficients. However, this selection does not seem to be sufficient to mitigate the large number of coefficients.

# When the sample size increases, the Q2 computation becomes less sensitive to the polynomial degree.

# %%
# Conclusion
# ----------
#
# We observe that on the cantilever beam example, to use a polynomial total degree equal to 4, we need a sample size at least equal to 50 to get a satisfactory and reproducible Q2. When the degree is equal to 4, if the sample is small, then depending on the particular sample, the predictivity coefficient can be very low (i.e. less than 0.5). With a sample size as small as 20, a polynomial degree of 1 is safer. However the limited sample size may have an impact on other statistics that could be derived from a metamodel calculated on such a small training sample.
