Create a random walk process
============================
"""
# %%
# This example details first how to create and manipulate a random walk.
#
# A random walk :math:`X: \Omega \times \mathcal{D} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d` is a process
# where :math:`\mathcal{D}=\mathbb{R}` discretized on the time grid :math:`(t_i)_{i \geq 0}` such
# that:
#
# .. math::
#    \begin{aligned}
#      X_{t_0} & = & \underline{x}_{t_0} \\
#      \forall n>0,\: X_{t_n} & = & X_{t_{n-1}} + \varepsilon_{t_n}
#    \end{aligned}
#
# where :math:`\underline{x}_0 \in \mathbb{R}^d` and :math:`\varepsilon` is a white noise of
# dimension :math:`d`.
#
# The library proposes to model it through the object *RandomWalk* defined
# thanks to the origin, the distribution of the white noise and the time
# grid.
