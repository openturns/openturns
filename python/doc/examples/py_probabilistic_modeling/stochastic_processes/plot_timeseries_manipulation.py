Time series manipulation
========================
"""
# %%
# The objective here is to create and manipulate a time series. A time series is a particular field where the mesh :math:`\mathcal{M}` 1-d and regular, eg a time grid :math:`(t_0, \dots, t_{N-1})`.
#
# It is possible to draw a time series, using interpolation between the values: see the use case on the Field.
#
# A time series can be obtained as a realization of a multivariate stochastic process  :math:`X: \Omega \times [0,T] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d`   of dimension :math:`d` where :math:`[0,T]` is discretized according to the regular grid :math:`(t_0, \dots, t_{N-1})` . The  values :math:`(\underline{x}_0, \dots, \underline{x}_{N-1})` of the  time series are defined by:
#   
# .. math::  
#    \forall i \in [0, N-1],\quad \underline{x}_i= X(\omega)(t_i)
#   
#
# A time series is stored in the **TimeSeries** object that stores the regular time grid and the associated values.
