"""
Create a white noise process
============================
"""
# %%
# This example details how to create and manipulate a white noise.
# A second order white noise
# :math:`\varepsilon: \Omega \times \mathbb{D} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d` is a stochastic
# process of dimension :math:`d` such that the covariance function
# :math:`C(\underline{s},\underline{t})=\delta(\underline{t}-\underline{s})C(\underline{s},\underline{s})`
# where :math:`C(\underline{s},\underline{s})` is the covariance matrix of the process at
# vertex :math:`\underline{s}` and :math:`\delta` the Kroenecker function.
#
# A process :math:`\varepsilon` is a white noise if all finite family of
# locations :math:`(\underline{t}_i)_{i=1, \dots, n} \in \mathbb{D}`,
# :math:`(\varepsilon_{\underline{t}_i})_{i=1, \dots, n}` is independent and
# identically distributed.
#
# The library proposes to model it through the object *WhiteNoise* defined
# on a mesh and a distribution with zero mean and finite standard
# deviation.
#
# If the distribution has a mean different from zero, The library writes
# message to prevent the User and does not allow the creation of such a
# white noise.
