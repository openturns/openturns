"""
Create a discrete Markov chain process
======================================
"""
# %%
# This example details first how to create and manipulate a discrete Markov chain.
#
# A discrete Markov chain :math:`X: \Omega \times \mathcal{D} \rightarrow E`, where :math:`E = [\![ 0,...,p-1]\!]` is a process
# where :math:`\mathcal{D}=\mathbb{R}` discretized on the time grid :math:`(t_k)_{k \geq 0}` such
# that:
#
# .. math::
#    \begin{aligned}
#      \forall k > 0,\: \mathbb{P} ( X_{t_k} \> | \> X_{t_0},...X_{t_{k-1}} )  =  \mathbb{P} ( X_{t_k} \> | \> X_{t_{k-1}} )
#   \end{aligned}
# 
#
# The transition matrix of the process :math:`\mathcal{M} = (m_{i,j})` can be defined such that:
#
# .. math::
#     \begin{aligned}
#         \forall t_k \in \mathcal{D}, \forall i,j < p , \> m_{i+1,j+1} = \mathbb{P} (X_{t_{k+1}} = j \> | \> X_{t_{k}} = i)
#     \end{aligned}
#
# The library proposes to model it through the object *DiscreteMarkovChain* defined thanks to the origin :math:`X_{t_0}` (which can be either deterministic or uncertain), the transition matrix :math:`\mathcal{M}` and the time grid.
