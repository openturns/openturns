Create a truncated distribution
===============================
"""
# %%
# In this example we are going to define truncated distributions.
#
# It is possible to truncate a distribution in its lower area, or its upper area or in both lower and upper areas.
#
# In 1-d, assuming a and b bounds, its probability density function is defined as:
#
# .. math::
#    \forall y \in \mathbb{R}, p_Y(y) =
#          \begin{array}{|ll}
#            0 &  \mbox{for } y \geq b  \mbox{ or }  y \leq a\\
#            \displaystyle \frac{1}{F_X(b) - F_X(a)}\, p_X(y) & \mbox{for } y\in[a,b]
#          \end{array}
#
# Is is also possible to truncate a multivariate distribution.
