Create a mixture of PDFs
========================
"""
# %%
# In this example we are going to build a distribution whose PDF is defined by a linear combination of probability density functions:
#
# .. math::
#    f(x) =  \sum_{i=1}^N \alpha_i p_i(x), \quad \alpha_i \geq 0, \quad \sum_i \alpha_i = 1
#   
# The weigths are automatically normalized.
#
# It is also possible to create a mixture of copulas.
