"""
Generate random variates by inverting the CDF
=============================================
"""
# %% 
#
# Abstract
# --------
#
# In this example, we show how to generate random variates by inversion of the cumulated distribution function. In simple situations, this method is rarely used in practice because of problems with performance, statistical quality of the generated random variates and numerical accuracy of the generated numbers when we use floating point numbers. However, it is an interesting method to know about because it is a building block for other algorithms and can be used to visualize the distribution of the generated numbers.

# %%
# The WeibullMin distribution
# ---------------------------
#
# Let :math:`\beta>0` and :math:`\alpha>0` be two real parameters: :math:`\alpha` is a shape parameter and  :math:`\beta` is a scale parameter.
#
# The cumulated distribution function of the WeibullMin distribution (also referred as `Weibull distribution`) is:
#
# .. math::
#    F(x) = 1 - \exp\left(-\frac{x-\gamma}{\beta}\right)^\alpha,
# 
#
# for any :math:`x\geq \gamma`. For the sake of simplicity, we set :math:`\gamma=0`
#
# In some situations, this parameters are denoted by :math:`k=\beta` and :math:`\lambda=\alpha`.
#
# The inverse of the CDF is:
#
# .. math::
#    F^{-1}(x) = \beta \left(-\log(1-p)\right)^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}
# 
#
# for any :math:`x\geq 0`.
#
# This is the *quantile* function, because it computes the quantile :math:`F^{-1}(x)` depending on an outcome :math:`x`.

# %%
# Loss of accuracy when the probability is close to 1
# ---------------------------------------------------
#
# In practice, if the probability :math:`p` is *very* close to 1, then the complementary probability :math:`1-p` is close to zero. This can lead to a significant loss of accuracy when we evaluate the subtraction :math:`1-p` with floating point numbers because :math:`p` and 1 have lots of common digits. This is called a *loss of accuracy by catastrophic cancellation*, a problem which is common in extreme events. 
#
# We can use the :math:`\textrm{expm1}` function, defined by the equation:
#
# .. math::
#    \textrm{expm1}(x) = \exp(x)-1,
# 
#
# for any :math:`x\in\mathbb{R}`. This is *not* numerically equivalent to computing `exp` and then subtracting 1. Indeed, the `expm1` function is more accurate when its argument `x` is close to zero. 
#
# The CDF is then:
#
# .. math::
#    F(x) = -\textrm{expm1} \left(\left(-\frac{x}{\beta}\right)^\alpha\right),
# 
#
# for any :math:`x\geq 0`.
#
# For the quantile function, we can use the :math:`\textrm{log1p}` function, defined by the equation:
#
# .. math::
#    \textrm{log1p}(x) = \log(1+x)
# 
#
# for any :math:`x>-1`.
#
# Therefore, the quantile function is:
#
# .. math::
#    x = \beta \left(-\textrm{log1p}(-p)\right)^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}
# 
#
# for :math:`x\geq 0`.
#
# Note that for :math:`\gamma > 0`, the quantile function writes:
#
# .. math::
#    x = \gamma + \beta \left(-\textrm{log1p}(-p)\right)^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}
# 
#
# with :math:`x\geq \gamma`.
#
#
# In the following, we will not use these robust equations and this issue will not be taken into account.

This would create a simpler, but less interesting example: this is a trade off that we accept in order to better understand the algorithm.)
