Graphical goodness-of-fit tests
-------------------------------

We gather some graphical tools to validate whether a given sample of data
is drawn from a given continuous distribution of dimension 1.

We denote by :math:`\left\{ x_1,\ldots,x_{\sampleSize} \right\}` the data of dimension 1
which have been independently generated by the random variable :math:`X`.
Let :math:`F`  be a  continuous cumulative distribution function.

We want to validate whether :math:`X` follows the distribution characterized by :math:`F`.

QQ-plot
~~~~~~~

The Quantile - Quantile - Plot (QQ Plot) is based on the comparison of some quantiles
between the tested distribution and the empirical ones. Let :math:`q_{X}(\alpha)` be the quantile of order
:math:`\alpha` of the distribution :math:`F`, with :math:`\alpha \in (0, 1)`. It is defined by:

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
       q_{X}(\alpha) = \inf \{ x \in \Rset \, |\, F(x) \geq \alpha \}
     \end{aligned}

The empirical quantile of order :math:`\alpha` built on the sample is defined by:

.. math::

    \begin{aligned}
            \widehat{q}_{X}(\alpha) = x_{([\sampleSize \alpha]+1)}
    \end{aligned}

where :math:`[\sampleSize\alpha]` denotes the integral part of :math:`\sampleSize \alpha`
and :math:`\left\{ x_{(1)},\ldots,x_{(\sampleSize)} \right\}` is the sample sorted in ascended order:

.. math::

    x_{(1)} \leq \dots \leq x_{(\sampleSize)}

Thus, the :math:`j^\textrm{th}` smallest value of the sample
:math:`x_{(j)}` is an estimate :math:`\widehat{q}_{X}(\alpha)` of the
:math:`\alpha`-quantile where :math:`\alpha = (j-1)/\sampleSize`, for :math:`1 < j \leq \sampleSize`.

The QQ-plot draws the couples
:math:`(x_{(j)}, q_{X}\left(\dfrac{j-1}{\sampleSize}\right))_{1 < j \leq \sampleSize}`.
If :math:`X` follows the distribution :math:`F`, then the points should be close to the diagonal.

The following figure illustrates a QQ-plot with a
sample of size :math:`\sampleSize=50`. In this example, the
points remain close to the diagonal and the hypothesis “:math:`F` is the
cumulative distribution function of :math:`X`” does not seem false,
even if a more quantitative analysis should be
carried out to confirm this.

.. plot::

    import openturns as ot
    import openturns.viewer as otv

    ot.RandomGenerator.SetSeed(0)
    distribution = ot.Normal(3.0, 2.0)
    sample = distribution.getSample(150)
    graph = ot.VisualTest.DrawQQplot(sample, distribution)
    otv.View(graph)

In this second example, the tested continuous distribution is clearly
false.

.. plot::

    import openturns as ot
    import openturns.viewer as otv

    ot.RandomGenerator.SetSeed(0)
    distribution = ot.Normal(3.0, 3.0)
    distribution2 = ot.Normal(2.0, 1.0)
    sample = distribution.getSample(150)
    graph = ot.VisualTest.DrawQQplot(sample, distribution2)
    otv.View(graph)


Normal probability plot (Henry’s line)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This test is dedicated to the normal distribution.

The following result is used in the test: if :math:`X` follows the :math:`\cN(\mu,\sigma)` distribution,
then :math:`(X-\mu) / \sigma` follows the :math:`\cN(0,1)` distribution. Furthermore, let :math:`q_{\cN(\mu,\sigma)}(\alpha)`
be the quantile of order :math:`\alpha` of :math:`\cN(\mu,\sigma)` and let :math:`q_{\cN(0,1)}(\alpha)`
be the quantile of order :math:`\alpha` of :math:`\cN(0,1)`. Then we have the relation:

.. math::

   q_{\cN(0,1)}(\alpha) = \dfrac{q_{\cN(\mu,\sigma)}(\alpha) - \mu}{\sigma}

Then the Henri line draws the QQ-plot built from the empirical quantiles of order :math:`\dfrac{j-1}{\sampleSize}`
and the quantiles of same order of the :math:`\cN(0,1)` distribution. If the sample comes from the :math:`\cN(\mu,\sigma)`
distribution, then the points should be close to the line of equation :math:`y = \dfrac{x-\mu}{\sigma}`.

The following figure illustrates the Henry’s line
with a sample of size :math:`\sampleSize=50`. In this
example, the points remain close to a line and the hypothesis “:math:`X` follows
a normal distribution“ does not seem
false, even if a more quantitative analysis
should be carried out to confirm this.

.. plot::

    import openturns as ot
    import openturns.viewer as otv

    ot.RandomGenerator.SetSeed(0)
    distribution = ot.Normal(10.0, 2.0)
    sample = distribution.getSample(50)
    graph = ot.VisualTest.DrawHenryLine(sample)
    otv.View(graph)

In this second example, the hypothesis of a normal distribution seems
far less plausible because of the behavior for small values of
:math:`X`.

.. plot::

    import openturns as ot
    import openturns.viewer as otv

    ot.RandomGenerator.SetSeed(0)
    distribution = ot.LogNormal(2.0, 1.0, 0.0)
    sample = distribution.getSample(50)
    graph = ot.VisualTest.DrawHenryLine(sample)
    otv.View(graph)



Kendall plot
~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the bivariate case, the Kendall Plot test allows one to validate whether a sample is drawn from
a given copula or to check whether two samples share
the same copula.

Let :math:`\inputRV = (X_1, X_2)` be a bivariate random vector with the copula :math:`C` and
the marginal cumulative distribution functions :math:`(F_1, F_2)`.
Let :math:`(U_1, U_2) = (F_1(X_1), F_2(X_2))` be the random vector with :math:`\cU(0,1)` marginal distributions
and :math:`C` copula.

Let :math:`(\inputReal_i)_{1 \leq i \leq \sampleSize}` a sample drawn from :math:`\inputRV`. We build the rank sample
defined by :math:`(\vect{u}_i)_{1 \leq i \leq \sampleSize}` where :math:`\vect{u}_i =(F_1(x_{1,i}), F_2(x_{2,i}))`.

We define:

.. math::

   H = C(U,V)

where :math:`(U,V)` is a bivariate random vector with :math:`\cU(0,1)` marginal distributions and :math:`C` copula.
We denote by :math:`K_0` the cumulative distribution function of :math:`H`.

We can get a sample of :math:`H` denoted by :math:`(h_i)_{1 \leq i \leq \sampleSize}` from the sample
:math:`(\vect{u}_i)_{1 \leq i \leq \sampleSize}` as follows:

.. math::

   h_i & = C(u_{1,i}, u_{2,i}) \\
       & =  \Prob{F_1(X_1) \leq u_{1,i}, F_2(X_2) \leq u_{2,i}}\\
       & = F_{(U_1, U_2)}(u_{1,i}, u_{2,i}) \\
       & \approx \widehat{F}_{(U_1, U_2)}(u_{1,i}, u_{2,i})

where :math:`\widehat{F}_{(U_1, U_2)}` is the empirical cumulative distribution function
of the sample :math:`(\vect{u}_i)_{1 \leq i \leq \sampleSize}`.
Then, we have, for all :math:`1 \leq i \leq \sampleSize`:

.. math::

     \widehat{h}_i = \frac{1}{\sampleSize-1} Card
     \left\{  j \in [1,\sampleSize], j  \neq i, \, | \, X^j_1 \leq X^i_1 \mbox{ and } X^j_2 \leq X^i_2  \right \}

From the sample :math:`(h_i)_{1 \leq i \leq \sampleSize}`, we build the ordered sample
:math:`(h_{(i)})_{1 \leq i \leq \sampleSize}`.

Let :math:`(H_{(1)}, \dots, H_{(\sampleSize)})` be the order statistics of :math:`(H_1, \dots, H_{\sampleSize})`.
Then we know that the cumulative distribution function of :math:`H_{(i)}` is the composition between the cumulative
distribution function of the :math:`Beta(i, n-1+1)` distribution and the distribution :math:`K_0` of :math:`H`:

.. math::

   F_{H_{(i)}} = F_{Beta(i, n-1+1)} \circ K_0

Let :math:`w_i` be the statistic defined by:

.. math::

    w_i = \Expect{H_{(i)}}

Thus we have:

.. math::
    :label: wi

    w_i = \sampleSize C_{\sampleSize-1}^{i-1} \int_0^1 t K_0(t)^{i-1} (1-K_0(t))^{n-i} \, dK_0(t)

For a given copula :math:`C`, equation :eq:`wi` is evaluated by Monte Carlo
sampling: we generate :math:`N` samples of size
:math:`\sampleSize` from :math:`C(U,V)`, in order to get
:math:`N` realizations of the statistics
:math:`H_{(i)},\forall 1 \leq i \leq \sampleSize` that are used to calculate :math:`w_i`
as the empirical mean of :math:`H_{(i)}`.

The Kendall Plot draws the points :math:`(w_i, h_{(i)})_{1 \leq i \leq \sampleSize}`.
If the points are on the first diagonal, the copula :math:`C` is
validated.
In particular, we can use the Kendall plot to test the independence between :math:`X_1` and :math:`X_2`
by using the independent copula to calculate the values :math:`(w_i)_{1 \leq i \leq \sampleSize}`.

To test whether two samples share the same copula, the Kendall
Plot test draws the points
:math:`(h^1_{(i)}, h^2_{(i)})_{1 \leq i \leq \sampleSize}` respectively
associated to the first and second sample. Note that the two samples
must have the same size.

In the first example, the Kendall Plot test validates the use of the Frank copula for the given sample.

.. plot::

    import openturns as ot
    import openturns.viewer as otv

    ot.RandomGenerator.SetSeed(0)
    copula = ot.FrankCopula(1.5)
    sample = copula.getSample(100)
    graph = ot.VisualTest.DrawKendallPlot(sample, copula)
    otv.View(graph)


In the second example, the Kendall Plot test invalidates the use of the Frank copula for the given sample.

.. plot::

    import openturns as ot
    import openturns.viewer as otv

    ot.RandomGenerator.SetSeed(0)
    copula = ot.FrankCopula(1.5)
    copula2 = ot.GumbelCopula(4.5)
    sample = copula.getSample(100)
    graph = ot.VisualTest.DrawKendallPlot(sample, copula2)
    otv.View(graph)



Remark: In the case where you want to test a sample with respect to a
specific copula, if the size of the sample is greater than 500, we
recommend to use the second form of the Kendall plot test: generate a
sample of the proper size from your copula and then test both samples.
Testing this way is more efficient.
