Reliability, sensitivity
========================

Sensitivity analysis methods can be used to analyze the respective importance of each
uncertainty source with respect to a probabilistic criterion.
This covers ranking methods for probabilistic criterion on central dispersion (expectation and variance)
and probability of exceeding a threshold / failure probability.
