Meta modeling
=============

The current section is dedicated to the building of an analytical approximation of the response of a given model.
Such an approximation is commonly referred to as a response surface in the literature.
This methodology is relevant if each model evaluation is time consuming.
Indeed, once a response surface has been built up, the various propagation steps may be applied at a negligible cost.
A special focus will be given to polynomial response surfaces.
