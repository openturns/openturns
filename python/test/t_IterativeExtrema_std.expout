Iterative extrema, one point at a time
result= IterativeExtrema((min = 10, max = 12), (min = 20, max = 22)
Iterative extrema, one single sample
result= IterativeExtrema((min = 10, max = 12), (min = 20, max = 22)
Iterative extrema, one single sample, then one point at a time
result= IterativeExtrema((min = 10, max = 12), (min = 20, max = 22)
