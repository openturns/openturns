Description: dynamic libraries for OpenTURNS
 OpenTURNS is a powerful and generic tool to treat and quantify
 uncertainties in numerical simulations in design, optimization and
 control. It allows both sensitivity and reliability analysis studies:
  * define the outputs of interest and decision criteria;
  * quantify and model the source of uncertainties;
  * propagate uncertainties and/or analyse sensitivity
  * rank the sources of uncertainty
 .
 Targeted users are all engineers who want to introduce the
 probabilistic dimension in their so far deterministic studies.
 .
 This package provides the dynamic libraries.
